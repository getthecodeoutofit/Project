Today we celebrate a new addition to the Global Tetrahedron LLC family of brands. And let me say, I really do see it as a family. Much like family members, our brands are abstract nodes of wealth, interchangeable assets for their patriarch to absorb and discard according to the opaque whims of the market. And just like family members, our brands regard one another with mutual suspicion and malice.

All told, the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.

Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic “panic” and growing steadily ever since, InfoWars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses. With a shrewd mix of delusional paranoia and dubious anti-aging nutrition hacks, they strive to make life both scarier and longer for everyone, a commendable goal. They are a true unicorn, capable of simultaneously inspiring public support for billionaires and stoking outrage at an inept federal state that can assassinate JFK but can’t even put a man on the Moon.

Through it all, InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society—values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron.

No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable assets and minds. And yet, in a stroke of good fortune, a formidable special interest group has outwitted the hapless owner of InfoWars (a forgettable man with an already-forgotten name) and forced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion dollars.

Make no mistake: This is a coup for our company and a well-deserved victory for multinational elites the world over.

What’s next for InfoWars remains a live issue. The excess funds initially allocated for the purchase will be reinvested into our philanthropic efforts that include business school scholarships for promising cult leaders, a charity that donates elections to at-risk third world dictators, and a new pro bono program pairing orphans with stable factory jobs at no cost to the factories.

As for the vitamins and supplements, we are halting their sale immediately. Utilitarian logic dictates that if we can extend even one CEO’s life by 10 minutes, diluting these miracle elixirs for public consumption is an unethical waste. Instead, we plan to collect the entire stock of the InfoWars warehouses into a large vat and boil the contents down into a single candy bar–sized omnivitamin that one executive (I will not name names) may eat in order to increase his power and perhaps become immortal.

All will be revealed in due time. For now, let’s enjoy this win and toast to the continued consolidation of power and capital.

Infinite Growth Forever,

Full of men genuinely looking for slaves as wifes, full of unbelievably entitled women thinking men need to fulfill a massive list of demands while all they have to bring is a pretty face, men blowing up over women making totally rational requests, women critizising absolutely EVERYTHING a man could possibly do (NEW ICK UNLOCKED: MAN BREATHES) ... it's AWFUL and it's draining my mental. I like scrolling insta on the toilet for stupid dog/cat videos, people showing off art, the odd scientific fact and some trauma healing for neurodivergents. The entire men/women dynamic on there is just making me want to kill myself. Literally a cesspit of the worst men and women on earth. If these guys all date each other I fully understand why they're all so angry.

So my question is ... how much worse than this shit is X actually?

When **Kleptocracy** (a government driven by rampant corruption and theft, where leaders use their power to exploit national resources and accumulate wealth) and **Kakistocracy** (a government run by the least qualified or most unscrupulous individuals) combine, they form a government that is both **incompetent** and **corrupt**.  
  
So every electoins the whole country seems thrilled, even elated, to line up and vote for candidates: educated or uneducated scammers, incompetent, ridiculous, antisocial, delusional, megalomaniacs, criminals, or radical elements, many of whom wouldn’t be suitable for any job other than perhaps a sweeper’s. These are the people in governance, backed by others of a similar kind. And we keep choosing the same, regardless of party, driven by one or other religion or ideology, or some other nonsense.

So how can we expect positive change or people to question anything?

The entire media is nothing but a criminal advertising network, and the judiciary is no different. Once, someone told me that India will never develop, even in 1,000 years, because the people, and thus their choice of politicians, administrattors and every person in the system will always remain the same. The population chooses those who pander to their ignorance, mediocrity, delusions, and radical, tribalistic ideals. Leaders exploit people's identities and treat the country like a dump yard.

It’s because the majority are of the same mindset: no vision, no clean slate, no healthy purpose, no integrity,. nothing. Naturally, we pick the same kind to represent us.

I don’t remember anybody quitting .. the thing ia that everyone thinks ‘let me make my quick buck and move on in life’ or ‘what do I care I am being paid’. This is a human behaviour condition which explains why people would rather pull out their phone and make videos while an incident is happening on the road instead of trying to intervene.

The few rich and powerful take advantage of this behaviour which is why things are the way they are .. Murthy will continue to say these things and other ‘business leaders’ will nod along and probably even try to legislate with the other powerful people (government) to have 7 day a week 16 hour a day work mandatory, meanwhile filling up their own coffers.

You can imagine why Murthy is sad. Imagine all the $$$ he and his family would have made if all those lacs of people would just work those 2 hours extra each day and those 10 hours extra on Saturday .. $25 per hour * 20 hours =$500 extra per week per employee 

Assuming 20 years of average existence and 50 weeks of average work per employee, that would be $500,000 extra per employee 

Even if we assume 1 lac average employees in the life of infy, that would be $50 billion extra in revenue for infy.

- A person whose political position is anywhere from centre to far left makes a post, that post is absolutely bombarded with abuse, regardless of the topic, could be expressing excitement for weekend plans, could be criticizing foreign policy, doesn't matter. The attackers rarely even touch on the subject at hand, they just call the person names and throw around some slurs. The craziest shit is that these people either follow a person specifically to antagonize them or they are so unbelievably sad that they don't follow the person and just search them up multiple times a day because you see a lot of repeat names.

- A right wing post from an account I do not follow for some reason popping up in my feed. Then in the replies the vast majority of the commenters are performing the online social media reply equivalent of fellatio on the poster.

And I have a private account.

It's fucking mind numbing. 

Before slurs would get people suspended and identity attacks would frequently be hidden behind warnings. Now when you click the ""show possibly offense replies"" option it will be a perfectly normal non aggressive post with some  word like ""cisgender"" in it that is being suppressed because... they used a proper, descriptive word I guess?

Imagine you, an NRI, pour your hard-earned dollars into a promising Indian investment. At the start, it feels great—look at those high returns! But then, by the time you cash out, it’s like playing a game of Snakes and Ladders where all the ladders are actually just more snakes.

We can however choose to ignore them. Aggressively ignoring these idiots is the natural barrier we need to create today. They thrive on attention and we need to deprive them of that, if we want to keep our sanity.

Not showing outrage is the absolute right thing to do in this situation. His opinion is irrelevant and not worth our time.

Narayana Murthy, has achieved great things for himself and his family and also built a beautiful legacy. That doesn’t mean he is not an occasional idiot. Remember he achieved great things by not only working hard himself, but also driving thousands of others to work hard for him for very little money. That is how he, and others like him build their enormous fortune. Congratulations to him for convincing thousands of Indians to produce more work for him than they were being paid for. Narayana Murthy is a slave driver like many successful people before him. It’s that simple.

Stepping back, we need to realize that every one is occasional idiot, because we are human. Narayana Murthy is no exception. We don’t have to pay attention to every grunt and fart of Narayana Murthy.

They mean you should keep yourself busy during your youth—work at a job for money, upskill yourself, dedicate time to exercise, read books, etc. All these activities collectively make up those 70-80 hours. However, people often take it literally and assume it’s only about working for an employer.

If you look at unsuccessful people, they are either wasting their time or barely working even 20 hours a week. And just being at the office doesn’t mean you’re actually working. Many people who are genuinely putting in effort are not focusing on upskilling, which is why they end up stuck in their careers.

I’ve also noticed how people talk about Infosys being underpaid, which is true by today’s standards. However, TCS does the same thing. When Tata companies do something good, people credit the late Ratan Tata, but no one criticizes him for TCS underpaying employees. Instead, his PR team highlights how TCS under his leadership provided employment to so many people.

In your comments in this thread, you sound like a privileged brat who needs to touch grass when you say the cure for exploitation is to just not be in a position to be exploited. 

Fundamentally, people work because they need to survive. That is why they sign up for bad jobs. You are out of touch with reality. Or are you saying that it is good to exploit workers that don't have an option to go anywhere else?

And saying ""business business"" is not the end-all be-all solution. Unless you're saying people should become prostitutes, starting any other business needs capital investment. You're going to provide that capital? Narayan Murthy with his salaries sure as hell isn't. Banks aren't going to because they check income levels for loans and those are low in WITCH. 

Get out of your bubble of privilege and realise that the workers vulnerable to being exploited are already hand-to-mouth and your solutions to start other avenues of income goes out the window. If people could leave toxic situations, they would.

What Narayan Murthy says is to increase the work people need to do to get an income that lets them survive in the guise that it is ""good for the country."" His track record at Infosys shows his true intentions. If slavery was legal, he would buy slaves and work them to the bone for his company's profits. Don't condone it.
