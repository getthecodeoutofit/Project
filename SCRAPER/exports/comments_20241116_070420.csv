If we want manufacturing to return to the U.S., we’ll face higher prices one way or another. Tariffs can create that price gap until domestic production ramps up. The real question is whether people are willing to pay more to make that happen, and whether we want to pay more until it happens. Most, when they’re honest, probably aren’t.

Edit: This is not a defense of Trump or his proposals. But tariffs are a tool that have a use. Biden used them in his term.

Tariffs are a a tax, and on a basic level taxes are designed to reduce the use of something, e.g. tobacco/alcohol, as well as raise Govt. revenue.  
  
Trump is hoping that by putting up the cost of imported (mainly Chinese) goods, that will spur US companies to make these goods. The problem is, many Chinese made products are not made by the US at all, so new companies will have to be created, or existing companies will have to begin designing and manufacturing them.  
It is possible, but would take a few years at least.

In the 1980s/1990s, Japanese car makers built car plants in the US to get around high import tariffs, so Trump's tariffs could work, but we will have to wait and see.",143,2024-11-09 07:30:26,0.0723967,t3_1gmyook,0,172

lw6p938,1gmyook,Lorberry,"(Short explanation for those who need it)

Tariffs are *situationally good* when being used to protect domestic industries from international suppliers attempting to run them out of business by selling at a loss (the Walmart strategy), and/or other similarly malicious practices. There is, hypothetically, a situation where a blanket tariff would make sense.

But there's a ton of shit for which the US has no domestic production spun up, even when looking at generic products and not specific brands. New factories and the like could (and probably would) spring up, but even optimistically, it can take *years* to ramp up modern production lines and supply chains. And since we all know companies are loath to cut into their profits unless they have to, a lack of competition means those tariffs are going to get passed straight on to the buyer - either us as consumers directly, or US companies who will similarly pass the increased prices on.

Hypothetically, the tariffs could *eventually* lead to more US manufacturing jobs being created. But even *if* that ends up being true, the decade or so it would take to get there will *suuuuuuuck* for anyone without enough savings and/or currently disposable income to take the hit. And that's ignoring all the middlemen businesses that would likely disappear in the meantime.",3,2024-11-09 07:36:35,0.0930682,t1_lw6j350,0,217
lw6payb,1gmyook,TheSleepingPoet,"***A Deeper Economic Analysis*** 



If Donald Trump’s proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports is enacted, console prices in the U.S. may experience a significant increase. Analysts predict that gaming hardware, particularly consoles like the PS5 Pro, could rise by up to 40%, potentially reaching a price point of $1,000. These tariffs encourage domestic manufacturing; however, they are likely to result in immediate price hikes across various consumer electronics categories, including laptops and graphics cards, which could have a ripple effect on global markets.

Simulations conducted by the Consumer Technology Association indicate substantial price increases for electronics overall. High-end graphics processing units (GPUs) could rise from $900 to $1,300 USD, and consumers can also expect price increases in monitors and personal computers. While some gamers are concerned about Trump’s previous criticisms linking video games to social issues, his current focus on tariffs may more directly impact the availability and affordability of gaming products.

For consumers outside the U.S., the effect will depend on how these tariffs alter global supply chain dynamics and pricing models, as manufacturers may adjust their prices across different regions.",85,2024-11-09 07:36:53,0.0635965,t3_1gmyook,0,182

“The team behind menstrual health and period tracking app Clue has said it will not disclose users’ data to American authorities, following Donald Trump’s reelection.

The message comes in response to concerns that during Trump’s second presidency, abortion bans that followed the overturn of Roe v. Wade in 2022 will worsen and states will attempt to increase menstrual surveillance in order to further restrict access to terminations.

Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin has blocked a bill in the state that would have banned law enforcement from enforcing search warrants for menstrual data stored in tracking apps on mobile phones or other electronic devices, according to the Houston Chronicle. And other states have passed or attempted to pass bills that would require medical care facilities and providers to report why women received abortions, as well as other personal information…

In a statement online yesterday from Clue, CEO Rhiannon White said, “Clue was created to give you the ability to build your own cycle health record and to be able to use it to gain invaluable insights to help give you agency when it comes to your menstrual and reproductive health.

“With Clue, you have the ability to better understand what’s going on inside your body. It turns your data into a resource. One that can help you discover and anticipate patterns, identify changes, make informed decisions, and in some cases, even save your life.”

She added: “It’s why we so firmly believe that as women and people with cycles, our health data must serve us and never be used against us or for anyone else’s agenda.”",466,2024-11-09 08:47:39,0.0416667,t3_1gn0sj3,0,267

They're the biggest consumer of Chinese made computer components and video game consoles. It's not JUST gaming equipment either, it's all electronics that use chipsets made in China. 

Unless you're a Gen Z'er making over $138,000 a year, you're losing money on tax credits, voting for Trump (compared to Harris). Where's that money going you asked? It's going to the earners who make MORE that $138k a year. Under Trump: $6,255 in tax credits to people making $217k a year, $22,000 to those making $590k a year, and a whopping $377,000 credit to those making over $14m a year. Conversely under Kamala, she gives no tax credit increase to those making over $591k a year, and INCREASES taxes on all the tax brackets after that, finishing with a tax INCREASE of $167,000 on earners making over $14million a year. 

Let me ask you this Gen Z? Why should you get less tax credits while the top 0.1% of earners get $377,000 a year in additional tax credits? Do you really think that rich MF'er needs that money more than your broke ass needs a boost in your tax refund? It may only be $400-$500 exta under Harris, but thats 1-2 months of groceries. That's 1-2 car payments. Were any of you that voted for Trump paying attention? Why were you so willing to take Trump at his word that he'd lower income tax too?

You’re absolutely right that we do need to call out toxic masculinity and it is core to ***some*** guy’s self perception. 

The problem, to me, is we often go beyond criticizing the toxic masculinity and go to criticizing all masculinity/men. 

Telling someone their opinion doesn’t matter because of their race or sex goes beyond criticizing toxic masculinity and goes straight to judging someone and treating them differently ***because*** of their race/sex. 

It often seems more like a cathartic attack more than anything else. 

Let’s criticize the toxicity instead of the gender. 

>so we didn’t coddle the most privileged group in society about the problems of toxic masculinity, and they burn society down in retaliation? 

It’s not about coddling. When you tell a group of people they don’t belong at the table, can we really be surprised they either went home or went and sat at another table where they were welcomed? 

We all need to be allies to each other instead of tearing each other down.

You can be located to within a few meters of precision by just knowing which WiFi networks are within range of your device (BSSIDs) and their signal strengths - without you even connecting to them. The companies out there who benefit from such information do not rely on putting all their eggs in one basket so to speak - they source a myriad of meta data to continuously build the most in-depth profiles they can. EXIF data in photos, NFC, Bluetooth, OS+Browser+plugin versions for fingerprinting, Cookies, pattern analysis … all of it funnels into these systems.

If you start talking about government overreach then the gloves really come off and they can leverage LPRs (license plate readers), facial recognition, financial transactions. EZ Pass trackers, cell tower pings, and so on. It is extraordinarily difficult to maintain any realistic sense of truly being anonymous and off the grid - to the point you’d have to be perpetually in a state of complete (justifiable) paranoia, and even then it’s a matter of slipping just a little to leave behind a footprint. 

I’m not saying all of this pertains directly to a period tracking app, but more broadly speaking … there’s very little to be done to avoid being tracked.

404 Media broke the story based on documents it acquired that appear to be written by cops in Detroit, Michigan. The documents include a memo describing the problem and warning other law enforcement officials to watch out for the problem.

[ … ]

The lock state of an iPhone determines how easy it is for cops to use third-party tools like Cellebrite to break in and root around. When an iPhone boots after a loss of power, it’s in BFU and much harder to get into. Cops can still brute force their way into the phone, but it’s harder and the data they can extract is limited.

[ … ]

In Detroit, the cops have no idea why the iPhones are rebooting, but they suspect it might be a security feature of iOS 18.0. Stranger still, the reboot occurred in phones that were in airplane mode and one that was inside a Faraday box which typically blocks outside signals. The cops suspect that the phones might have communicated with each other somehow.”",382,2024-11-09 14:12:06,-0.039418,t3_1gn5s30,0,204

The virus that subtly destroyed Iranian uranium enrichment facilities to prevent them from creating nuclear weapons. They did this without invading the country and starting a war.

Unconstitutional data collection. They can't legally know this even if not brought up in Court. You don't have to submit evidence onto self either.

And if you still want to use ai. Upload a photo of the paper to a service that doesn't store information at all. Or make this anonymous. IP and personal identifying type information that tracks to you not uploaded or collected. No device names. No mac addresses. No identifying data that it.

A lot of police or FBI collect information the illegal way to find other information then they don't leave a trace of this information and find ways to explain how they got this other information without illegal collection of other information to get the information.

Sometimes they may argue some of this illegal information but without backing up how they got the information if a person doesn't know to argue that there is no way to collect this information legally.

They built a case knowing things they couldn't legally know and then have to find excuses on how this could be collected too. Such as her say someone told them. Or you made mistakes and this information was left in public. Millions of unprovable ways in their position. Evidence not submitted because they used that for other evidence.

Then of they can't illegally spy they say it's going dark when the only part going dark of information they can't legally obtain. They base whole court cases on these things. Apparently even use your menstrual cycle too.

They most likely want your shit too to know what you been eating and about health problems you don't know you have for future argument. Use that to attack people. We didn't know you had those problems. This wouldn't hurt anyone else. If police know a suspect is injured they pretend it off that they didn't know before arresting a person violently anyway to damage them further because they want to harm and get away with the crime. Because they consider themselves to be the punisher and not the Courts. They will do this even when there is no evidence of crimes.


Power corrupts and police are people so out of every thousand people vs every thousand police there is more criminal police per thousand compared to non police but they are just people too. They are in a position of power to be more likely corrupt compared to your average citizen. Police ate government because they for government law. Not civilians.

If you want my ex girlfriends period data it's on a paper calendar book. She tracks this herself. But you will have to break an entering to get it if you have no search warrant for the property. She keeps the door locked.

If (say for example) NVIDIA and/or AMD knows that they can just stick to the existing TSMC fabs in Taiwan, then tank hit of the tariffs by raising prices by 30% and pocketing the extra 10%, they most likely will as opposed to vesting into a fab that will take a decade to build prior to the first dies leaving it's doors.

Or (what I would probably believe to be the more likely scenario) they will double dip and do a combination of both foreign and domestic production; in which they raise the prices of the imported chips by 30% to tank the hit of the tariff + plus a bit of profit, AND then they'll sell the domestic chips for the same 30% markup since they know that the market will pay any way.",17,2024-11-10 04:16:22,0.100765,t1_lwb4nwp,0,152

lwcop76,1gnhyk9,doneandtired2014,">I don’t believe Trump will fix those things, but he talked a better talk if those are your primary problems.

This is where I disagree.

He rambled incoherently, sold some easy solutions to people too stupid or intellectually lazy to understand the cause of their problems, and they latched onto it like barnacles.

For example:

Eggs and chicken are expensive? That happens when you cull 500k+ birds multiple times a year due to a viral infection with a tendency to jump species (gee, when in recent memory has that happened) and demand doesn't drop. And egg vendors will not drop margin to make them affordable because they have a duty to their shareholders to move that line up no matter the cost to the consumer.

Gas is ""high""? Demand went up post COVID as people started driving more, OPEC burnt through its cash reserves trying to strangle domestic production in the crib by subsidizing the shit out of it and it can't afford to do so any longer, the world's second largest producer is being sanctioned for war crimes, and we have fewer refineries now than we did even in 2020: you could drown the US in 1000x the crude it needs and it won't matter because you only have a finite number or facilities to turn it into anything useful. ""Drill baby drill"" isn't going to get $1.25 gas. Period.

Rent is too damn high? Blame Realpage for that because most corporate landlords use it, they have (knowingly or not) been price fixing for the past decade, and the DOJ is now getting around to suing them (expect the case to drop now that there's a Republican admin inbound). Taxes also went up and that gets passed onto the renter 

Can't buy a house? Venture capital and hedge funds owned by people just like Musk and Thiel are snapping up single family homes for 5 figures over list, in cash, no inspection required to turn into rentals, air bnbs, or to do a shitty flip and sell it for $50-$100k more than it was bought. Foreign nationals are also snapping up the same homes + condos in order to launder money. A Harris administration was primed to do something about it, a Trump admin will look the other way because his oligarch buddies didn't become super billionaires by not squeezing people dry. And building on federal or protected land is not going to fix this because they will get snapped right the fuck up by those firms and foreigners the second a foundation is poured. There's also the fact that Cheetoh's previous tariffs (which Biden kept in place) in conjunction with some supply chain issues *still* impacting the manufacture/production of raw materials like wood and metal have made building materials so expensive that is not enough margin to be worthwhile for most contractors.

Etc. etc. etc.

I could go on and on about the source of their issues and a few solutions for them but it wouldn't do any good because I've lost their attention 4 words in, I'm not promising them the moon + a hand job, and they're too fucking stupid to understand a Tariff is a tax that is ultimately passed onto them. And here's the thing: I consider myself to be of a average intelligence. I didn't go to college to study economics or engineering or trade or healthcare, I'm an average dude who just pays attention and even *I get this shit*.

Fuck it. They sold the country, its social progress, and its hegemony out for whatever vague promise of peanuts they could parse out of demented word salad and I wish nothing but ill onto them for it. I straight up do not believe democracy is a viable form of government at this point in time because the overwhelming majority of the electorate are basically oxygen thieves unworthy of empathy or pity.",5,2024-11-10 08:10:12,-0.0352744,t1_lwcfyv4,0,649

lwcplz8,1gnhyk9,CarpeMofo,"Democrat/Liberal messaging is objectively terrible. Any time a good idea is floated, they come up with a god awful slogan or phrase to go along with it that sounds terrible without actually knowing the meaning. ""Let's take some money from the police budget to pay a broader range of professionals to handle ordeals police aren't trained to handle."" turned into ""Defund the police."". They could have just said 'Improve police crisis management' (I'm not a slogan writer) or something similar and it would have went over way better. Biden's ""Let's rebuild American infrastructure!"" turned into ""Build back better!"" what the actual fuck does that even mean to someone who doesn't know the policy behind it? Another terrible one from the 2018 mid-term elections 'For The People' ""What for the people? Cookies? Puppies? Double anal penetration?"" or Biden's slogan for this election before he dropped out ""Together, we will defeat Donald Trump, again."" fucking terrible.

You know what is a fantastic slogan? ""Make America Great Again"" it's simple, it evokes emotion and it's not confusing. I'm liberal as hell but even I'm like 'Damn, I really do wish America could be great again.' once I remove the context of douchebags wearing the hats. Most voters are low information. They don't read paragraphs about economic policies or whatever. You have to give them something catchy that tells them you're going to *do* something or point out something people like about the candidate. Either be somewhat specific like Herbert Hoover's campaign slogan ""A Chicken in Every Pot and a Car in Every Garage"" or use wording that will force them to fill in the blanks with their own best-case scenario such as ""Make America Great Again"". 

This kind of political messaging has existed and been popular ever since the 1840's with William Henry Harrison and his running mate John Tyler has the slogan 'Tippecanoe and Tyler too!' referencing Harrison's nickname from his status as a war hero after winning the battle of Tippecanoe. Then James Polk had the slogan ""54-40 or Fight!"" referencing coordinates of an area contested with England. Then Lincoln used the slogan ""Vote Yourself a Farm"" to refer to the homesteading act allowing tons of people to have their own farm then during the middle of the civil war he used ""Don't Change Horses In Midstream"". 

So, the average voter has been low attention span, low information people who like slogans for a long time. Slogans are literally memes and people have always liked memes. Say what you want but people *remember* 'Just Do It' 'Think Different' 'Got Milk?' 'Where's the beef?' 'Breakfast Of Champions' 'Like a Good Neighbor, State Farm is there.' and 'Finger lickin' good!'.",2,2024-11-10 08:16:11,0.0913889,t1_lwc2p7d,0,447

But I do know some people talked to him and the next day or so he changed his mind and said he liked some of it(I don't even think he knew what it was up to that point), so he plans on getting rid of the parts he doesn't like. He says there's woke stuff in it he doesn't like, so he wants to do a sort of repeal-and-replace with a non-woke version.

lwdakw6,1gnp2ph,anchoricex,"Work in tech. Worked 10 years in aerospace in a union. 

When the going’s good, you’d be hard pressed to find tech workers who are pro-union. Things are good you see pay is good coffee is free WFH is cool, why would we need a union… they are surprisingly right wing with much of their reasoning. To a fault of course. 

I’m particularly tilted when folks in tech actively go out of their way to be against unions, despite never having worked in one, despite often times coming from families who’s union paying jobs put them through their comp sci degree at whatever university. There’s a weird obsession with revering the hero-trajectories of startups in tech. Even among workers who.. have never worked at a startup and instead work for a medium/large entity.. they still say “we should be like a startup” “I envy startups for being lean and mean” and so on. I don't think anyone disagrees with these ideas, but the kneejerk assumption that unions are just automatically the antithesis of these things is just a weak, low-effort take.

Anyone whose brain ticks in code & has a knack for problem solving assuredly feels like inefficiencies extrapolated to anything is something to be solved. We’re all wired this way or just have a lot of practice working through things this way. Where it gets hairy, and in my opinion particularly stupid, is when tech peoples have something to say about organized labor as being inefficient. Not only are most workers in tech pretty naively blind to the dynamics, difficulties and complexities that result in organized labor, it’s interesting to me that for folks who can assess and architect grand solutions with many touchpoints and ultimately build huge end to end things… cannot simply see how poorly they draw assessments when it comes to organized labor. Like you gotta zoom out, you're looking at one corner of the architecture diagram here, and there's a lot of old *and* recent history that really paints a picture of something needing to be solved that you're missing when you write off unions. It’s like trying to speak to a stack/language you’re actually unfamiliar with, but trying to come from some place of authority. We all see people who make remarks about x language on hackernews with unwarranted levels of confidence, only to see replies proving them completely wrong. We are acutely familiar with that dynamic, we have to accept that we are just as likely to exhibit the same type of shit when we discuss labor. We cannot allow ourselves to Ben Carson this shit (expert in neurosurgery, [but that clearly does not qualify him to be an authority on other things](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/presidential-candidate-ben-carson-stands-belief-pyramids-built-store-grain)).

I can and do have these conversations when other companies are being discussed among my coworkers. I’m somewhat regularly dumbfounded at the hubris of the workers I find myself around sometimes, lots of notions about invincibility. Engineers who can build things delude themselves into thinking they should never go long without work because *they can build the things*, and the spirit of sole-proprietorship / entrepreneurship you might find with coders gets quickly lost in grandiose overconfidence. 

**If things continue the way they’re going for too long, American tech workers will soon find themselves hoping a union is a possibility for them as well.** I’m always amused when someone who works at tableau/salesforce/etc is actually completely blindsided, surprised, heartbroken and unprepared when layoffs happen. Absolute deer in the headlights when it happens to them. Like surely they’ve walked this earth long enough to know that the machine/entities that are these companies are just gonna minmax everything every step of the way with zero read on whether or not it’s actually a bad idea to lay your dept off. Everyone got mad at outsourcing, everyone cheered at insourcing, and now things are tipping back to outsourcing paired with LLM. It’s going to get uglier, and there are just way too many lessons to be learned from labor history in America already. Anyone who thinks that *But This Time, It’s Different* is smoking metaphorical techbro crack. 

It is somehow lost on tech workers that a lot of what organized labor fights for isn't simply good wages. When you bargain, everything is up for discussion, hell you get to bargain for Lacroix being removed from the premise for violently deceiving tastebuds. You get to bargain for a binding contractual agreement to guarantee work, to define what can and cannot be shipped overseas. And maybe that's all organized labor in tech needs to be, maybe we don't need organized labor to touch the wage-aspects of our sector for this because we accept and are okay with the current mechanics of wage-discovery, but maybe (probably) we still need organized labor to enforce that company execs cannot just spend a day on a golf course only to decide to transition whatever portfolio app overseas by the time they get to hole 7. It doesn't need to look anything like a machinist union contract/bargaining event, because our work is different. But the frameworks for unions can still serve and protect us & keep the promise of security in our homes/families/lives alive & guarantee us what we all want... simply to have a good *stable* life. 

We have been *sleepin* on this shit & we need it badly. Remember, good-faith bargaining does not seek to gut a company. It seeks to instate the stability needed for a company to thrive long-term, a feat that is often lost in todays world & the cyclic short-sighted nature of controlling boards and what not. Good-faith bargaining does not ask for the company to bend the knee to them, it just asks that a little bit of balance is assured in worker favor, that we can feel safe & committed to continue to providing our efforts. Yeah, sometimes it gets ugly & good organized labor needs to be very strategic and sometimes lean into PR efforts. Sometimes you just gotta suplex the company, but rest assured as long as you're not demanding the moon...the company, which is more like a machine than it is human, will adjust. Any companies who cannot survive without shipping jobs overseas? It is of my opinion these companies don't got the sauce, they don't have what it takes to survive in the game, they have to drastically adjust the inputs somehow to stay afloat. And those companies can and should go under, that new ones form to fill the service/product that *can* play the game, and is willing to accept that the game requires stateside workers/talent. 

If we have even half the brain we claim to have, we should be looking towards the history of what the laborers of the past decades have fought for and how it was acquired. We should have a very near pulse-check with the state of organized labor and its future up ahead with the NLRB probably on some sort of chopping block.",290,2024-11-10 10:45:04,0.0308668,t1_lwd2poj,0,1160

I vote for those policies and parties, in spite of it not always being inline with my personal taxation benefits. The fact that human race could be better off in 20 or 30 years is incredibly personally satisfying: I want to see a future that is technologically amazing - eradication of diseases, exploration of the stars, or just more incredible entertainment options - with my own eyes before I die. And what better way than to invest in the future and have it pay back to me in better quality of life or a more peaceful world when I'm elderly and not-so-healthy. And if I'm 10-20% poorer in net worth for it then that's a price I'm willing to pay.

lwdn2t4,1gnp2ph,GoodBadUserName,"As someone who works in the banking industry and in a place with strong unions, I can tell you that not all unions are fun cakes and happiness.  
  
Unions help to protect unnecessary people, create excess costs and not always work as they should.  
  
Examples:  
A person who has several times caused damage due to neglect (hundreds of thousands of cost), not caring and sometimes feel malicious, has been protected by the union from being fired, and so he was moved from his position, retained in another less chance to cause harm position, because the union heads threaten to strike if he gets fired.  
The union demand the company to shell every year thousands per employee for small useless gifts in the name of the union, so they can be seen as if they are here, doing great, giving gifts etc, to make it seem like it is fun to have a union. That money could go into higher salaries or increase in work force where needed.  
The union's deal with the company about pay raises is good, but it blocks any higher increase due to high profits as the increase is locked to a certain percent due to the deal. In the past the bonuses and pay increases were much higher as there was no ceiling.  
The company did not side with a certain political side, trying to be neutral as company serves clients from all sides of the political map, and taking a side could really hurt its business and shunt hundreds of thousands of customers. Union heads threaten to strike if the company does not adhesive to a certain side. The company took a stand and said ""if you strike on politics, you are gone"". Union rushed to a lawyer who told them ""don't be stupid"", and they let it go.    
  
I'm not saying union is bad.  
You get steady salary increases to workers who wouldn't get without it. You get things like company resort, more free days, more paid leave etc. Tons of good stuff that some companies wouldn't give without a union (though my company gave those even before the union).    
I'm saying that not everything is perfect. There are some downsides that could hinder progression or hurt in costs even for the employees, not just the company.",4,2024-11-10 12:39:26,0.145794,t1_lwdakw6,0,383

 Does anyone really want to listen a rant about the woke mind virus that is protected by the first amendment when getting coffee? I work with low income people for a living. The trump supporters are way more likely to turn the conversation to politics then Harris supporters.

The US checks and balances are designed to stop one person from becoming dictator against the will of the people and the political establishment. And to that end, these checks and balances work exceptionally well.

The US has almost no checks and balances when the political establishment, supported by a significant part of the population, consciously chooses a dictatorship, or otherwise an illiberal regime. The whole ""respect of minorities"", ""multiculturalism"", ""tolerance of differences"", and other liberal values are by no means entrenched in the Constitution in a way that's not subject to interpretation. Some are just public policy which can be changed by regular law, some are Supreme Court precedents from a bygone Liberal era which can (and probably will) be overturned, some is just how society treats its fellow citizens in general. In the McCarthyist era, for example, none of these liberal values were held dear, and yet the country existed. It could exist that way again, whether we like it or not, until the next societal shift, which could be entire generations away.

 1) Political expression should be sacrosanct, particularly if it is unpopular. People forget that Obama ran on protecting us from the (dun dun duuuun!) Homosexual Agenda. He reversed himself later because of unpopular political expression becoming popular. Mostly because of the internet.

 2) If people are plotting to put me in jail, I would like them to do it as publicly as possible, without fear of retaliation. That way I can boop my little fanny right over to Canada if the movement gains traction. My Grandma was Cree, I can do it quite casually. 

 I would much rather every individual with beliefs I consider loathsome wear them right on their sleeve. That way I know things like how many there are, and who to avoid.

They should go play with them instead.

TV kinda sucks in most places with 200 channels to choose from but not a single one worth watching.

If something culturally valuable is on like the Sixth Sense, Rambo or Scarface, then they can watch.

If all else fails you can at least let them watch children's shows with kangaroos. Like ""Skippy"".

Joke aside I know that Australia is hot and half of the animals there deadly (even the kangaroos).

So the poor kid might be often at home, understandably. What I don't understand how people can live in Australia at all.

Cigarettes are 60 dollars, the temperature is 47°C, half of the plants and animals could kill you, and those pesky border controls even make drugs hard to come by and extremely expensive.

I asked several times already, what is left for an Australian to have joy? Is it Foster's and Vegemite? They tell me it's only Vegemite because Foster's is undrinkable.

Of course kids watch TV play video games and hang out on YouTube. What elso should they do. Not even the adults know what they should do.

Not even we Europeans know what to do. Since they banned smoking in pubs people stopped going to pubs. Then Facebook and whatsapp delivered the last blow to what was once known as social gatherings.

Expanding economic mobility and opportunity more broadly allows for the most efficient use of our scarce talent resources in the labor market.

Exit polling suggests otherwise. A lot of data suggests that a significant percentage of the electorate is *unbelievably ignorant*. They didn't vote for Trump's policies; they had no idea what they even were.

Exit polling also showed that Harris was more favorable than Trump, and that Trump was considered more extreme than Harris. You can also look to the Senate races in swing states, as well as states where Labor/Union rights were in play, and where Abortion protections were in play that the nation *did not shift to the right*.

When NPR did focus group polling asking undecided voters which policies they preferred (without identifying the candidate), Harris won convincingly.

lwhn9l3,1gnxlpo,Human-Kick-784,"The problem is deeper than kids using social media. Social media was a mistake and NEEDS international laws to limit and enforce better practices by companies that implement it.

I work in tech as a software engineer. The current proposed laws are far too broad and need narrower definitions, but honestly, many companies have overstepped with their products entering into social media territory. Something needs to be done, it's clear to everyone that social media is having an incredibly negative effect on society.

The problem with tech is that you can't cut the problem's head off with broad changes, because the problem space is a hydra. For every tictok, X and facebook you want to regulate, a new discord or bluesky will pop up that remains unregulated. It's also trivial to circumvent any restrictions with a VPN, and regulating THAT would cause an absolute shitstorm in the tech world. That being said, there's so much shared ubiquity across services now that enter into social media territory, there IS room for tech and governemnt to meet in the middle here.

A ban on this content for kids would essentially force tech companies affected to simply withdrawer from the Australian market. Social media needs to be recognised internationally as a problem that needs solving, and tackled at the global level.

Personally I'm in favor of a complete social media law shakeup, led by an international body.

We need better independents to vote for aswell outside of greens and the weed party the rest are some form of ""Australia/family values"" which equates to religious people wanting to throw religious rhetoric on everything :/

And yes individual donations up to a limit and no obligations attached to them , You show what your values and goals are you stick with them from the start of the campaign all through office and if people like that they give you money if they don't then, cool exit stage right come back next year with a better plan Not holding onto a new suger daddy corporations hand

And exactly no one can stop the dark web so there is never going to be an assurance with this sort of stuff,  I feel like it's almost set up to siphon More kids and teens into trafficking O.o 

Honestly if I was more outgoing i'd make a transparency party, make it so anyone who is running in it (including myself) has to put all receipts out for the public, (even if some of its redacted for personal items)  it would have to do with creating a stronger housing initiative and giving the short end of the stick back to investors (investing is essentially gambling and investors should not be the players And the house)

, upping education standards by actually focusing on the kids and teachers and ridding us of the curse that is this intense focus on funding and NAPLAN stats that skewer results, stress kids out and is atrocious for both the lowest and highest end students :/ we need schools that help those struggling find footing and help those excelling to find excellence!

No more political footballs, we live in a very Live and Let live country and it's one of the best things about Australia! But we need to raise the national standard for living from the bottom to the top not the other way around :/ we can't do that when we are busy arguing who deserves what rights.

Shut down any talk about how landlords are struggling, If you told me you own 5 houses and are struggling and you need politicians to protect your ""investment""   just sounds like your shit with money  

 you have the option to sell and make more money than you will see in your lifetime of renting then you can fix what's wrong with the other houses before they break down and then you get to keep passive income?!? There will always be opportunities for investment but when we focus on it as the be all end all for the economy it just ends up robbing average people :/

Once I heard a decent amount of talk about this starting just a few years back regarding companies trying to hide how much people were earning from other workers, I immediately started being much more open about it. Not only does it help people who are curious, it’s helps you if you find out someone is bringing in more for something you can do. It also lets me know I’m earning a good wage for what I do. It’s should be discussed more in a matter of fact way. I know a lot of people brag about it or maybe sheepishly hide it if they’re embarrassed but discussing it helps workers at all levels know where they’re at and as long as people are matter of fact about it and not braggarts or shitty then it can be a good thing. 

That said, when you earn a lot, it can change people perspectives about you. It’s hard to help that. But even that is helpful. Because now you know and can better set boundaries with certain people or friends",74,2024-11-11 08:01:44,0.195489,t3_1gogo9r,0,182

> We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together.

> **Akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades.**

> In this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly. A steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the Federal government.

> Today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been over shadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields. In the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research. Partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity. For every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers.

> **The prospect of domination of the nation’s scholars by Federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present and is gravely to be regarded.**

> Yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite.

> It is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system-ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society.


- Eisenhower Farewell Address

——

> Whereas it appeareth that however certain forms of government are better calculated than others to protect individuals in the free exercise of their natural rights, and are at the same time themselves better guarded against degeneracy, yet experience hath shewn, that even under the best forms, those entrusted with power have, in time, and by slow operations, perverted it into tyranny; and it is believed that the most effectual means of preventing this would be, to illuminate, as far as practicable, the minds of the people at large, and more especially to give them knowledge of those facts, which history exhibiteth, that, possessed thereby of the experience of other ages and countries, they may be enabled to know ambition under all its shapes, and prompt to exert their natural powers to defeat its purposes; **And whereas it is generally true that that people will be happiest whose laws are best, and are best administered, and that laws will be wisely formed, and honestly administered, in proportion as those who form and administer them are wise and honest; whence it becomes expedient for promoting the publick happiness that those persons, whom nature hath endowed with genius and virtue, should be rendered by liberal education worthy to receive, and able to guard the sacred deposit of the rights and liberties of their fellow citizens, and that they should be called to that charge without regard to wealth, birth or other accidental condition or circumstance**; but the indigence of the greater number disabling them from so educating, at their own expence, those of their children whom nature hath fitly formed and disposed to become useful instruments for the public, it is better that such should be sought for and educated at the common expence of all, than that the happiness of all should be confided to the weak or wicked:

You are paid to do a job. Is it done and on time? Then you did what you were paid for. Insisting otherwise is just opening yourself for exploitation and abuse, and that eventually leads to shitty workplaces that abuse and exploit all workers not just yourself.

As long as its satisfactory work, who cares? If the person cant do that, they get fired or demoted. You dont keep them around but with low pay while 1-2 people on the team get paid way more.

lwlnlol,1gouw4q,varky,"You're confusing Android as an OS with applications running on it.

The core is open source. In regards to features, it is barebone as far as apps go.

The problem with android is mostly the fact that binary blobs for hardware functionality are not open source and mostly never have been. It always relied on companies such as Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek to provide and build support for android to run.

Linux and 99% of the standard applications that make up one's Desktop Environment and experience, and well as the majority of applications used on them are Open Source, and the vast majority of them is licenced under GPL, which prevents companies from just making it closed source without rewriting and reimplenting most of the userspace. Something that's equivalent to making your own OS anyway.

Edit: if you really want an example of something built from open source that isn't open source, take a look at Orbis. That's the OS powering the PS4. Built on top of a BSD base which is open source but whose licence allows unattributed forks and modifications that don't require attribution. It's built by Sony for their consoles and it's not based on Linux because they couldn't do what they wanted to do with a Linux base without breeching copyright.",17,2024-11-11 22:01:50,0.0075,t1_lwll9o4,0,214

Sure, there are games on Windows but many of those now run on other platforms. Sure, people use it in business but there's a lot of identical software on other platforms. If people started transitioning when a new version of Windows came out then they'd probably never need to switch to the version after that.

It would take people breaking old patterns and learning new things. Most people are capable of doing that. Linux and MacOS are perfectly fine operating systems if people would take the time to get used to them. You can also emulate Windows for those few pieces of software you absolutely need and, as more people switch, the holdouts will become cross-platform or alternatives will pop up.

### edit:

Changed ""why people run Windows"" to ""why so many people run Windows"" because I didn't express my thought clearly. Obviously, Windows is a good solution in certain cases.

lwlnzdx,1gor0b7,Ill_Necessary_8660,"That's interesting, although it's never even remotely been enforced or even attempted to be enforced. People publicly reverse engineer copyright-protected products constantly and no company does ANYTHING about it, not even Nintendo. They don't touch Dolphin because they can't, even though Dolphin is a publicly released tool that breaks all copy protection and completely reveals all the hidden, mathematically protected code, immediately upon giving it a DMCA-protected Nintendo game. Dolphin also has built-in tools that are made specifically to freely make multiple copies of a game you give it into different formats. I think if this issue ever did end up in court, that part of it would certainly be nullified, and companies know that.

""Breaking copyright protections"" sounds so hackery and bad at first glance, but people need to take a step back and realize how silly the whole concept of banning that is, especially when it doesn't involve actual copyright infringement.

The idea that you can buy a few billion 1s and 0s and do something ""illegal"" with them (besides sharing/selling) is crazy. Like are you really telling me that glancing at the code of something I bought and writing it down elsewhere, or so much as moving one line of code to another line, is illegal depending on what that line does? Why would it be legal to play 100% of the code as intended, but not just 95% of the code if you felt like taking some out parts of it? Why would it not be legal to add a little bit of code on your own?

It's a civil infraction. It's enforced via the companies that were harmed initiating something (a lawsuit). You're right it's not usually enforced. But companies have tried to enforce it a lot more than they have succeeded.

For example, media companies initially sued customers in relatively large numbers over this. Then when they realized that looked bad they stopped. And then someone had the idea of hiring an outside company to sue on their behalf. This is legal, and it allows them to escape some of the bad PR.

The suits the resumed. But they have been largely blocked by ISPs. The ISPs have the same issue as the media companies had before, they don't want to be involved in punishing their own customers because it's bad business.

> People publicly reverse engineer copyright-protected products constantly and no company does ANYTHING about it

Reverse engineering is explicitly legal. To do it legally you have to reverse engineer a copy you paid for though.

> They don't touch Dolphin because they can't

I wouldn't count on that. Much like the Switch emulators people think these things are untouchable but don't instead realize that it's just that the company found no significant advantage to getting involved. And then that changes and the lawsuits fly.

> Dolphin is a publicly released tool that breaks all copy protection

It uses a key which leaked to decrypt the games. They thought since DeCSS never disappeared Dolphin would be safe. But it was declared illegal to distribute DeCSS.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_City_Studios,_Inc._v._Corley

And Dolphin may go the same way.

> ""Breaking copyright protections"" sounds so hackery and bad at first glance, but people need to take a step back and realize how silly the whole concept of banning that is, especially when it doesn't involve actual copyright infringement.

It's breaking copy protections as far as I know, not ""breaking copyright protections"".

> Like are you really telling me that glancing at the code of something I bought and writing it down elsewhere, or so much as moving one line of code to another line, is illegal depending on what that line does?

It's not. It becomes illegal when you then distribute that. You can do anything you want (just about) with what you have. But your ability to redistribute someone else's copyrighted content (even with modifications) is restricted.

> Why would it be legal to play 100% of the code as intended, but not just 95% of the code if you felt like taking some out parts of it?

Because the DMCA makes it illegal to break effective copy protection.

There are plenty of nonsense laws on the books, so arguing about the sensibility isn't terribly useful. But to pretend a law on the books doesn't exist or isn't enforceable is either stupid or presumptive. If you want to say the DMCA's legal provisions aren't enforceable you're going to have to come up with a strong constitutional argument about it and then win on that basis in court.

The law says that breaking effective copy protection is illegal. Even without redistribution. It was presumably put in there so that if you get a DRMed movie (rental) which can only be played for 2 days you cannot legally break the DRM and watch it forever.

And make no mistake. That law is on the books and has not been declared unenforceable so it is valid right now and we don't have reason to think it will be declared invalid.

You do not have a right to ""format shift"" content ever since the DMCA was passed if the content has effective copy protection. iPod ""rip, mix, burn"" was legal because CDs were not copy protected. But every physical and most streamable formats since then have been copy protected and so are not legal to decrypt and store elsewhere as a backup or otherwise.

If you buy a DVD or Blu-ray and rip it and put it on your own server you're breaking the law. There may be several reasons as to why you aren't ever punished, most of all being how does anyone even know? But it's illegal and thus doing that is not protected by law, in fact the opposite.

So this means maybe there is a way companies could try to sue Plex out of business. Will they? Probably not.

Imagine if Biden or Harris had said this? Everyone—left to right—would flip out, but when a Republican oligarch says it, the right-wing of this country says “cool.”

Edit:

My sincerest hope is that the people who voted for Trump, voted for someone other than Harris, or don’t vote at all will feel the full effects of his policies and be very aware of their origin.

I hate to say that—I don’t want anyone or their kids to suffer—but people are *going* to suffer, and I think those who helped elect him need to know what’s going on because most of them have no idea that Musk (whom Trump said he is going to hire) basically admitted (both in response to someone else and in a separate statement; both on Twitter) that his plans will cause some serious pain for a while.

Had that been front and center (and maybe it would have gotten more attention if it hadn’t all happened *just days* before the election), I think people might have freaked out (as I did when I heard it, and as they should have).

Midterms are two years away. Just in time for the people who will suffer under these polices to feel the pain and vote accordingly.

So, a company that understands ROI pays for the best tools for their staff internally at a nominal fee that is easily recovered due to the relative low cost of the tools vs the profit made from the output of the tools.

And no... companies don't usually buy tools for freelancers... because they are independent contractors / companies which is the point of being a freelancer, the client does not deal with all thier overhead, and they charge for that connivence.

The freelancers rate is usually higher then the equivalents staff hourly rate if they were full time but they are responsible for their own tools (software) just like they are their own pensions and medical etc. as freelancers.   But as a freelancer, they would cover the cost of the software in about 2 hours or less of working, which I would hope they have more than 2 hours of work on a project, or it's not profitable so you should not have taken it.

That's business, both sides, no assholes in the mix, just business.

Full time staff get's the fees for software covered, freelance contractors do not. the bulk of the time.

Both are in business and if they don't have the ROI to afford the tools to do business efficiently, they are not in the right line of work or need to use different tools.",-1,2024-11-12 00:11:25,0.213869,t1_lwmbs6n,0,233

lwmscwo,1gowt9m,Rhumald,"I still have that last version of Photoshop that wasn't subscription based, and I used GIMP when I was in College, as I couldn't afford PS at the time. The UI in PS feels a bit more intuitive, as it's all contained, stays in the same places, and has the same familiar main menus where everything you could need be be accessed and drilled down to from.

GIMP, on the other hand, is like what happens when someone tells you how multithreading works, and you decide to create an image manipulation program that is also a representation of that concept. - Not everything is easy to find in the main menus, it lets you undock everything and move them all anywhere, and every new tool screen has it's own sub-menus.

The end result is a loooot of control, but it also takes longer to familiarize yourself with the platform, and there is very little automation without diving headlong into scripting for it, or finding one of the multitude of plugins that set out to accomplish the task you're also looking to accomplish, to speed up your workflow.

What GIMP lacks, however, is what draws people to PS when they're first entering the creative workforce - a simple UI that has art tools front and center, and if you're using a tablet to draw or paint, it supports the input of the angle and pressure of the table pen effortlessly. - GIMP kinda struggles here, at least in it's current form, as it does not support full rotation of a brush, and sometimes it's pressure levels can be a bit off, and it's UI is really dated.

New users don't initially understand that they don't need one tool or editing platform to accomplish all of their art related tasks, and that actually, their tools probably work better when they were designed with the task at hand in mind, so they reach for the product that promises to do everything for them, while GIMP is and always has been basically a very powerful Graphical Image Editing Program, and that is what it's best used for. There are other free, or at least comparably inexpensive, tools out there if other types of art are more your jam. PaintTool SAI, Krita, LibreSprite, Piskel, Sketchpad, Inkscape, Clip Studio Paint, and Corel Painter, to name just a few of the free options, all are great for their own reasons, but it takes a bit of experience first to really know what you're looking for in an art program, and with so many options, people can feel both overwhelmed, and pressed for time.

The reality is that free programs take a fair bit of time to learn, and when you're not certain if you'll like if for what you had in mind, people feel more comfortable, again, reaching for PS, even if it's kind of a bit of a clown car.

 The good news for these newer artists, or people on the fence about trying a new program, is that a lot of the UI's are similar enough that skills transfer over easily enough, so you can start digging into the meat and potatoes of what the program does differently, and - more importantly, - better, a lot quicker these days. And if you really just need to ask someone about the program, they often have their own forums, and lot of people with a wealth of knowledge stream to twitch when they're doing art now, so if you need to ask a quick general question, even the small time streamers with audiences of 5-10 people are normally more than happy to answer them, so long as you're polite, and they're all great people.",14,2024-11-12 01:29:13,0.237978,t1_lwmgwt3,0,617

Also it's a godsend to the entire global population w/low income coming online - Adobe is never going to cater to them.

Hopefully, this wakes more people up about how much of our government is purchased and controlled by oligarchs and their companies.

lwnh7c2,1goqf3u,dmetzcher,"There’s that, which I think is *very* likely. Note that Trump was asked about Musk’s economic warning, and he said something to the effect of “don’t worry, it’s going to be great, no negative economic effects,” etc; basically, the literal opposite of what Musk said his own decisions will do. “Nothing to see here, folks,” is what it all amounted to, but the underlying message to Musk, whether he heard it or not, was “figure out how to not make me a liar, and stop saying scary shit while I’m over here trying to lie my way to victory.”

There’s also the fact that Musk has never worked in government before. Being CEO means everyone asks “how high?” when you say “jump,” but that isn’t how Congress works; they have voters and midterms to worry about while Musk can simply fuck off back to Twitter and Tesla. Hell, it’s not even how career employees in the Executive branch work. I predict he will become frustrated with people slow-walking his wish list or outright ignoring him, and he’ll be back to the private sector faster than any member of Trump’s first administration.

My prediction for RFK Jr is that he will be out on his ass, too, except I don’t think he’s even going to be offered a job. Giuliani and Christie both wanted to be AG. Trump hung it out in front of Christie to get his endorsement, and then he made fun of him during a press conference (while the idiot stood behind him looking like a chump) and never offered him a position. Granted, this was always because Christie had put Kushner’s father behind bars, so he was never getting the job, but my point is that Trump has made a career of screwing over everyone around him, so I have a hard time believing he doesn’t think Kennedy is an idiot and doesn’t want him fucking anything up. Plus, Trump is superficial and petty; he didn’t want to hire John Bolton because he has a mustache. Am I supposed to believe the way Kennedy talks doesn’t irritate Trump?

It isn’t about the content in the platform echo chamber. It’s that a dominant echo chamber that favors conservative voices creates an ecosystem dominated by conservative narratives. 

If we have two narratives, two sets of truth, so be it. XTwitter isn’t where people get news, but it does manage to help to set the narrative that is reported on elsewhere. 

More important than whether the Dem audience simply creates a separate or safe ecosystem is whether the Dem Party apparatus allows money to flow into it and allows policy rhetoric to flow out of it. This is essential in getting the mainstream media to pick it up and to report it as narrative and myth. If the Dem elite laughs or remains aloof, it’s just another forum for Dems to intellectualize.

lwpid2e,1gp7tqa,supermaja,"Here’s a nice little article called, “The Self-Experimentation of Barry Marshall”:

https://asm.org/podcasts/mtm/episodes/the-self-experimentation-of-barry-marshall-mtm-144

Dr. Marshall won the Nobel prize for medicine for his discovery of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), which causes peptic ulcers. 

It was widely believed in medicine that the stomach’s hydrochloric acid was too acidic to allow any bacteria to live. When Marshall presented his research on it, he was subjected to ridicule bc his discovery was considered impossible. 

So he cultured H. pylori and ATE IT. He became very ill and had a stomach biopsy that found he had H. pylori everywhere. (He had had a normal stomach biopsy before he consumed it.)

His self-experimentation was a highly dramatic step he took bc the researchers were not able to culture the bacterium in animals, so they couldn’t do any testing. The reaction among the medical community was negative—but 10 years later he was awarded the Nobel Prize.

The contributions he made to human health have been life-altering for millions of people. 

He had consent (his own); he ate the bacterium; he became ill; and he cured the illness that was caused. 

While self-experimentation may seem extreme…PEOPLE DO IT ALL THE TIME. People self-experiment with OTC drugs, rx drugs, street drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and food. They eat sugar to extreme excess. They eat poisonous fish for the thrill of surviving. 

I understand that self-experimentation is frowned upon, and I agree that it can have sometimes fatal outcomes, and it’s good to discourage it. 

Marshall took a huge risk, but it paid off in a huge way that benefitted the entire world, really. And I support his decision to do so. It was his personal decision. A person can literally eat any substance they want, legally (unless it’s a controlled substance), regardless of the outcome. Why can’t he? There’s no law that prohibits it, so he’s in the clear. 

The medical community says it’s good POLICY to discourage self-experimentation due to its inherent risks. This makes good sense as a policy bc it underscores the risk and prevents widespread self-experimentation. 

However, physicians are uniquely qualified to understand and appreciate the nature of the risk and its affect on the human body. We take risks because we believe the potential rewards are worth the potentially negative outcomes. We NEED to take risks to progress beyond what is known. And medicine has benefited tremendously from the knowledge developed through self-experimentation. 

If a highly informed person decides to take a risk, knowing it could kill them, to gain important knowledge that can benefit many others, I can support that. If Evel Kneivel can jump the Grand Canyon just bc he wants to see if he can do it, why can’t a physician scientist risk his life to help many others? If you can risk your life for the fun of it, you can risk your life to benefit others. It seems very clear that people can risk their lives pretty much anytime they want.

Their employers won’t likely agree with self-experimentation done at work due to the risk, but on the individual level, I see no problem with it.",8,2024-11-12 11:15:51,0.120685,t1_lwoc9c1,0,516

Reagan also beat Mondale by 16 plus percent but that is back then different demographics now. 

Back before we had 24-hour news and all that stuff people only knew what was said on the half hour news. 

I never said people were voting Republican, people who stay home who would usually vote Democrat that's simply a vote for Trump or whoever is running as the Republican. 

You're talking about suave people Bill Clinton suave guy regardless of people think about his sexual nature he was charismatic so was Obama and Reagan. 


Has nothing to do with Trump being a Republican is just historic what he did especially since the loss in 2020 it was just an amazing comeback and to have a coalition of all races not just MAGA that was huge. 

Does that mean he's great no does that mean Republicans are going to win in 2028 no it just means Democrats have to wake up and speak to the regular people forget about the things they campaigned on this time. 

You can't win on abortion and the other guy is Hitler. 


All I said it's easier for a Democrat to win the popular vote then a Republican.

Think about it there's around 39.8 registered Republicans and just about 50 million registered Democrats that's why it's hard to win the popular vote (nowadays).

When you always have a 10 million vote Head start nowadays for Republican to win like Trump did not easy. 

This year many people voted Trump or lot of Democrats stood home 

Like I said you can't lie about the economy people pay at the register they know the news can't say it's in your head like they did.

Mastodon is the most well-known example, but others like PeerTube, Friendica, and Pleroma exist.

It is decentralized and federated, but in a manner that is confusing when you try to apply ActivityPub architecture to it.

Jay decided not to build off of ActivityPub and create AT Protocol because there are some serious UX, scalability, and identity ownership issues with AP. See [this interview](https://www.protocol.ai/blog/transcription-bluesky-blog/) for more details.

There is also already several other services that can use your AT Protocol identity, such as frontpage.fyi (link aggregator), smokesignal.events (meetups), and whtwnd.com (blogging). This broader ecosystem is called the ATmosphere.

lwqizh9,1gp7tqa,Unique-Coffee5087,"There was a very interesting treatment created using adenovirus. This is a virus that causes cold symptoms, and it has a method for circumventing a cellular mechanism that causes a cell to kill itself when it is infected with the virus. Viral DNA inside a cell can trigger the protein p53. This protein initiates programmed cell death, and is also part of the mechanism for cells to destroy themselves if they become cancerous. Thus the p-53 protein is sometimes referred to as an anti-oncogene. Many cancer cells are defective in the p-53 protein. This is a necessary early step in the transformation of cells to cancer cells, because it prevents the cell's aberrant activities from triggering p53's cell killing function.

The adenovirus has a protein called E1A, which is able to bind to p53 and prevent it from working. Because of this, adenovirus is able to infect a normal cell and go through a standard viral life cycle which ends with that cell's death. A company developed a strain of adenovirus that has a defective E1A protein. This one does not interact with p-53, and so is not able to successfully infect a normal cell. But it is able to infect a cancer cell, if that cancer cell has an inactive p53 protein. And so the engineered adenovirus is able to freely in fact certain cancer cells and kill them. 

Onyx Pharmaceutical developed this as ""ONYX-015"".

I am also sure they are either academics or some IT people who work for some massive company where they have lots of free(company) time to work on this project.

The reality that I see is the real photoshop(and gimp) killer is going to be AI based. That is, it will have many of the basic editing tools we come to expect in such a tool, but much of the work will be somewhat prompt driven, or simple menu driven. If you have an image of a pop can and you want to have it sit on the table, you will do something like:

* Remove background from object. This might then highlight what object it thinks you mean. You select yes, and poof, the background is gone and any weird edge work you would do like feathering, etc all perfect.

* Paste can on table picture as another layer and say, ""Merge"". It would then make a series of offers for all the changes needed. Perspective, lighting, shadows, reflections, the lot. You might move a few sliders, and then approve.

Have those sorts of features, and 99% of the common use of photoshop or gimp is now covered.

Then there are all the really cool AI tools such as making a picture better. I watched a video where they took various famous paintings, pictures, etc and had AI expand the field of view. It was damn good. While pure prompt AI is very good, I suspect incorporating it with a more photoshop tool where you can adjust tweak, and then hand fix where it goes wrong, will be still very valuable.

I have worked with graphic artists many times over the years. I would suggest that photoshop is primarily used for composition or correction. Tools more like illustrator were used for original creation. I noticed the artists who used a screen as a painting canvas were often using non-adobe tools. This is not inside my skillset, so I didn't ask what they were using.",2,2024-11-12 17:45:05,0.163994,t1_lwokatn,0,367

lwqkglk,1gowt9m,Rarelyimportant,"In my personal experience I have not found European universities to be very open with their research. US universities release lots of research that is taxpayer funded that anyone is allowed to use(American or not, doesn't matter), whereas it often seems European universities charge for this research, which only serves to make it available to corporate interests but not citizens or small businesses.

One example is WordNet, a Princeton University built, and DARPA(US-gov't org) funded advanced interlinked dictionary that was worked on for decades and 10s of millions of dollars spent on it. It is one of the core components that many LLMs/language models use to learn language and word senses. It is free for anyone to download and use(including commercial use). WordNet was so beneficial and crucial to modern computer language research that many other countries copied it for their own language(I use ""copied"" here in the most positive sense). The European Commission even spent millions of dollars to fund EuroWordNet covering many European languages. Would you like a copy of this EuroWordNet that your European tax Euros paid for? Just the Dutch version alone will cost you 22k Euros for a license. So here we have this tool that we know is powerful and useful, that only exists because of the beauty that comes from free and open sharing and exchanging of ideas, but if you want to see Europe's it'll cost you 22k euros per language.

Obviously there is no requirement for the EU to release it, but considering it was influenced by equally funded research being released for free, and it was paid for by European taxes, it seems strange that it isn't. It's almost like vaccine deniers that say ""Everyone else got the vaccine? Great, I won't need to"". If everyone had the same mentality we'd got so far backwards it would be scary.

This is quite a common thing I see. Almost anytime there's some resource or research I'm interested in and it's from a European university, you have to pay for it. It's always priced at being just too expensive for the average person/small business, but a small, petty cash expense for a corporation. 5k-25k euros. Public tax money, and universities should be supporting the opposite, no?

sources:

- [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)

- [Dutch EuroWordNet](https://catalogue.elra.info/en-us/repository/browse/ELRA-M0016/)


EDIT: I should mention that I mean specifically PUBLIC funded research. Universities all over are less open with privately funded research, and the US is no different. But it's the publicly funded research I'm talking about here that the EU universities are equally closed off with.

All prices: Dutch €22k, Czech €6.5k, Extension to WordNet English €8k, Estonian €4.5k, French €11.5k, German €7.5k, Spanish €11.5k. Total ~€71,500/~$76,000. There are discounts for bulk which would bring it down a bit, but still it's about €71,495 above my budget. [Source](https://catalogue.elra.info/en-us/repository/search/?q=french+eurowordnet)

What's even more absurd to me is that even if you're a EU member, and you're going to use this data for _RESEARCH_ purposes, you still have to pay for it(though granted, it's substantially cheaper).

But now? We know exactly what’s happening. My algorithm was very broad because I was a heavy twitter user before Elon bought it. He pushed sensitive content all the way forward and because I was in political twitter in 2020, my algorithm just burst with all sorts of insane stuff from both sides.

Project 2025 isn't going to outright ban porn (there would be far too much backlash), it is going to classify anything related sex, sexuality or gender as ""porn"" and make ""providing access"" to children a felony.  Or more likely, they will start with their little ""civil liability"" game to skirt around the free speech issues.
  
The age portal thing they've been doing in the name of ""protecting the children"" is just a trial run for that broader narrative.  Right now they are connecting the ""protect the children from porn"" narrative to a real world mechanism - the age verification portals - to ideologically and legislatively cement that premise; that this is a real threat to children which requires action. Expect a federal version of this age-verification law to be a priority. At the same time, they have been pushing the narrative that ""sexuality is inappropriate for children.""  Next it will be ""LGBT love is sexuality.""  Then it will be ""LGBT love is pornographic.""  This is all setting the stage for a federal law which will allow people to sue anyone who ""provides access"" to LGBT adjacent materials.  Based on what we have seen in this recent election, this will be very popular among black and latino voters, as well as the standard moralist christians.

lwr2xzj,1gpkyjv,Chester-Ming,">On the Joe Rogan Experience podcast late last month, Trump said CHIPS Act is “so bad,” and said instead of helping fund new fabrication (fab) and R&D centers, the US should have put tariffs on overseas semiconductor makers. He compared the semiconductor industry to the auto industry as to how tariffs could work to bring back manufacturing.

Just a completely illogical move, as per usual.

Applying a tariff to a product does not solve the problem *unless you can actually manufacture this product within the US.*

He really has no clue how tariffs work does he? If he wanted to bring chip manufacturing to the US then he'd need to keep the CHIPS act in place and allow the fabs to be built *before* he applies the tariffs to overseas chip manufacturers.

It can work for auto manufacturing becuase America has already been manufacturing cars for over 100 years, the factories are already in place.

He ran on this broad ""tariff on all imports"" nonsense, so he either has to implement it which is wildely inflationary, or backtrack on the policy. Normally backtracking on a policy would be unpopular but Trump backtracks on everything and fails almost every target he sets and the people still vote for him so who knows anymore",443,2024-11-12 19:55:55,-0.0917614,t3_1gpkyjv,0,212

lwrgy6o,1gpasi8,SwagTwoButton,"I really think people need to sit down and do the math on what a billion dollars really looks like. Humans are just incapable of thinking that big. 
We go ‘oh that’s just a step up from a million. Yea a 1000 millions.’

So let’s convert a billion into a world we do understand. Time. Think how long you could live if you had to spend a $1 per second to stay alive. 

1 million second? About 11 days. 
1 billion seconds? 31 Years. 

median American net worth - $192k net worth  - 2.5 days
Trump: ~$7 billion. - 222 Years 
Musk: ~300 billion - 9000+ years. 

How about distance? $1 = 1 inch 

1 million inches? About 15 miles 
1 billion seconds? About 15k miles or 2/3 a lap around earth 

median American - $192k net worth  - 3 miles
Trump: ~$7 billion. - 4 laps around earth 
Musk: ~300 billion - 190 laps. 

Put it this way. Musk could sell off enough of his assets to just give up his lead as the richest man in the world and be tied for first. The horror. It’d be about ~$75 billion. 

I’m not even going to ask him to give it away. He can keep it. But he can put it in a 2.0% return investment account. The safest investment ever. 
If he just gave away the accumulated interest. About $1.5 billion a year. He could give away $4 million dollars A DAY til the end of time

The fact that instead of just coasting without doing this, he is actively now putting his entire wait on the scale to swing things even more in his favor? Evil.

My best bet is that the KGB, and later agencies, just quietly collected evidence of him (and everyone else) engaging in money laundering, stuff like that.

My guess is it's as simple as Putin being able to prove conclusively that he's a criminal and Trump not wanting to fuck with that.

I don't think there's a conspiracy, at least not one they've truly discussed. I think it's just gangsters who all have guns pointed at each other, metaphorically speaking. Don't break the truce and we all get richer. I don't think it's more complicated than that.

Rotate your keys on a fairly regular basis(Couple of times a year). Please note: I am not talking about user passwords, your actual VPN keys. Least trust, make sure that your keys are stored/secured in a way that only exposes those keys to the people who need them(i.e. you have a roommate/spouse, you shouldn't know or have access to their passwords, while still allowing them a way to reset them).

In terms of a VPN, from a C-SEC standpoint: make sure only the people you intend to have access to your system, have access to your system, and validate that assumption every couple of months. If a bad actor has gained access to your system, *and you don't know about it* that is pretty much the worst case scenario for a VPN, IMHO.

For example, it's why Jacobins don't come back into French political life, and why we don't see more bounce-about Bolsheviks floating around.

So the GOP has been captured by fascists - that's the fact of things right now. The real question is not everybody is on board, and while they will most certainly purge the party of Non-Trump loyalists.

The question will be what happens when fearless leader dies. Who would be the heir apparent. JD Vance, how effectively has he been shown to lead the fascist branch of the party - and in this regard the GOP is still terminally fucked, aside from sucking off Donald Trump and living in fear of his vengeance that's what exists except for.

Most importantly, this is thieves breaking into the house , the party does not want to ""lead"" in the traditional sense , every last one of them appears to want to treat their access to the Presidency in 3 major ways.

Faction 1 - Silicon Valley Tyranny - Elon Musk, Peter Thiel potentially JD Vance - these guys have been in town for 5 whole minutes, have a vast ignorance of the federal government but they are a good deal smarter than the usual Trumpy fuck-abouts, the ""move fast, break things"" method of working will probably blow up something very important - but won't have the slightest notion of the consequences of their blow-up. These guys are not much for sticking around after the train-wreck so I'd expect them to bail or want to get out at the first sign of trouble; THAT will be whenever whatever they did is reported as bad and makes Mr. Trump be reported as an idiot. So the minute the press connects the dots to their fuckups this will move fast.

Faction 2 - Team Gilead - The Project 2025 clown cart - these guys DO have exceptional knowledge of the federal apparatus and I fully expect they will be the most destructive to the infrastructure and rights and apparatus of the federal government. These guys are easily the most dangerous, because they know the landscape, are almost certainly the most well informed legally, and they mean damage, and they will be almost certainly able to accomplish that.

Faction 3 - Holdovers - These are the clowns from the previous circus - largely kakistry additions , they weren't competent to begin with, they aren't competent now, and can certainly do damage in their particular department but it's going to be locally bad and more globally less bad. Much more into self serving their own interests and fucking up particular portions of government usually to their own aims - how well this goes is just about anyone's guess, but some of them like Betsy De Vos represent powerful anti-democratic efforts not specifically aligned to the neo-fascists from silicon valley. 

The glue will be Steve Bannon - who's definitely not the guy for the job, as smart as the 2025 guys , not as smart as the Silicon Valley folks but EVERYONE takes their cues from St. Petersburg/Moscow. 

Should Trump die or become incapacitated much like Stalin, the loyalty is grounded in fear of reprecussions, without Trump to be the mad-king, the various factions would be left in the untenable situation of picking a new leader to the fascist wing of the party, or to try to corral the now freed from their Trump-age fear, Republicans who will no doubt feel their oats and want nothing but to exact revenge on the infighting and radicalism; moderate Republicans become , if not a coherent force, a looming drag on the ""MAGA - Trump"" Party.

So all of this, of course , hangs on Donald Trump and his failing faculties - and limited understanding of things, so how well these clowns can schmooze the boss are going to be what we all experience as governance and chaos, here again throwing directives from Beijing and Moscow into the mix, it will be chaotic, treasonous and hopefully fails on it's own internal faction fighting, but that's overly optimistic thinking given the very bad situation we're in presently.

I'm tired of being gas-lit by tech companies squeezing the utter life out of my tech curiosities to supplant them with data mining. IT ALWAYS HAPPENS THIS WAY MOVING FORWARD. Half the crap calling themselves ""Open Source"" are owned by corporations that have the final say in anything. I'm sure that's by deceitful design because business cannot be trusted anymore to do the right thing anymore by default. As wrongfully assumed. That's how disillusioned I am with the online world and especially anything close to a ""social media"". Yet, who is responsible for me allowing myself to be squeezed like this? It's me, OFC. I'm always the one expected to change to a world I already innately knew was wrong from the start that I was put here to challenge. The buck stops here. The script flips now. I am not defensive anymore. Deal with my offensive or not. You're not the boss of me and you don't pay me enough to care anymore.   

Edit to add to respond to the original article. I don't trust the narrative of the path of the rise of the CEO from what little is said on Wikipedia about her. How do we know she's not an operative to another inevitable distraction, bread/circus disillusionment? This is not a sexist question more than a principle one. 

I challenge anybody that has actually looked to simply reply what Bluesky's CEO's name even is to this comment lest you be assumed a bot of the dead internet kind and be rightfully blocked by the discerning. *If you have even read this far, please respond what her name is in reply to this message. I have been a team leader before and incorporated this technique to find who the real ones are on my team. The ones who respond are the ones to watch out for. 

As an aside, if you are a team leader, you can always use these kinds of questions within the body of your daily report email criteria  to test and see who is paying attention amongst those you have to report to. Nobody cares nor responds nor pays attention for the most part. They just want a wordy response. Just make your responses vague enough to not instantly fire them for paying attention. ""Hey what were you going off about paying attention in the middle of that rant"". Make them document it in explanation so you can hand to unemployment your evidence for going against the machine when they make you position redundant. Anyway corporate politics rant over. 

I want to clearly delineate and state that I, as an American, as a self-admitted idiot, I DO NOT hate on Chinese people in general. They're common good people  under-represented unfortunately by their manipulative governance that acts not as insane as the US globalist crazy-makers. I am not a Chinese apologist, just an objective observer that the mass collective seriously seems good. 

Every mass is complicit for it and acts like it does not while we're left confused not collectively admitting to the truth. Not gonna fall for it again. I'm not playing this game again with Bluesky. It will be popularized by the left leaning/centrists sick of all fascist-usurped social media only to be subverted by ""next ratcheting-up minority collective that stands to benefit from the confusion-creation"" again just like everywhere else online. We need a true, decentralized, double encrypted standard that cannot be silenced/subverted by anyone that is stupid simple to use.

Then you have zero tariffs on building materials and extremely low property taxes which means people build like crazy and there is an oversupply of housing so rent is affordable. Do you see a pattern forming here? The cost of living is a tiny fraction of what it is in a place like the US.

How can the US expect to bring manufacturing jobs back in a way that will be competitive without addressing any of these underlying cost differences? The answer you tend to hear is ""automation"" but the reality is that even machines need to be maintained by someone and when manufacturing was outsourced they did, in fact, automate everything they could. The reason this was done was to prevent workers from being able to take over the factories with specialized skills that could be used to bottleneck production during strikes. 

So now Americans are expecting to be able to out compete the industries they outsourced with some hand waving about automation without understanding that the factories they will be competing with are already highly automated. How do you jump in front of that while having far higher costs across the board?

It's all user-submitted data, so my prominent theory is misattribution. The article notes that ""Verizon Fios is a fiber-optic internet, TV, and phone service provided by Verizon."" So if I call my friend who uses Verizon's VOIP phone service, and I can't get ahold of them because their service is currently down, I might attribute that to \_my\_ provider being down. And if I can't reach Facebook because My ISP is down, I might attribute that to Facebook being down.

Another important factor to consider is that ISP outages don't always look the same. Sometimes things break for only \_some\_ Internet routes. So maybe I can hit Google but not Facebook, and my friend who lives a state over isn't impacted at all.

Its Israel that wants to kill the internet to hide their atrocities.

They will probably employ the same people that bombed Nordstream and former Nazi Von Leyen will be too happy to blame it on Russia too like the last time.

Like with Nordstream, Russia has nothing to gain and everything to lose.

Bombing the EU made the EU dependent on fracked gas, there is no way in hell Russia would want us all dependent on Musknet.

And Chinese exports won’t be reduced. They will just sell to other countries in SEA, Europe, LATAM, Middle East, and Africa. Other countries will jump at the chance to import more Chinese products (and even sell them back to the US for marked up prices). Their products aren’t going to magically evaporate just because Walmart set up a plastics factory in Michoacan.

Even then, Mexico and the rest of LATAM doesn’t have the industrial nor technological capabilities to absorb China’s offloaded manufacturing even for low level products. Mexico would have to compete with Bangladesh, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc for those jobs and Mexico are at an economic, social, and logistical disadvantage already.

So unless Americans are fine with paying 2x for all the products they’ll be buying OR drastically cutting back on the levels of consumerism for the rest of their lives, then this scenario you’re suggesting is not realistic. Only other option is for the billion dollar companies to sell at competitive prices similar to Chinese manufactured products but suffer massive cuts to their profits.

lwswz8k,1gpasi8,red286,">What does anyone do if it's worthless?

If the USD is worthless, then foreign currencies (including crypto) skyrocket in value.

One major issue with cryptocurrencies is that they're incredibly difficult to spend.  Most businesses won't take them, and the few that do will take you to the cleaners on the exchange rate because it's so volatile.  Worse, it's *incredibly* difficult to liquidate huge amounts (eg - billions of USD worth), and doing so would cause the value to crash.

So how do you get around that?

Simple, first you devalue the USD as much as possible to maximize the exchange rate.

Then you convince the US government to adopt a cryptocurrency (likely Bitcoin) as a national ""digital currency"".  This will then force the US government to purchase billions of USD worth of cryptocurrency, which will *also* spike the value of said cryptocurrency while also finally providing a huge institutional buyer for it all.

And then about 5-10 years after the economic catastrophe caused by that, the USD will start to rise in value again, so all these crypto bros with billions or trillions of recently converted USD will be on top of the world, and US corporate assets will all be available at fire-sale prices, ripe for hostile takeovers by the newly minted moneyed class.",2,2024-11-13 01:41:54,0.00495455,t1_lwphkqx,0,215

Trump made that statement that he was leaving it to the Governors.  I am sure that was based on talking to lawyers.  I wish he would have spent some time explaining just why he was doing that so it was more clear to people that didn't understand.

With that said, I wish he had done more.  He could have worn a mask even though he didn't want to, to provide a roll model.  He could have branded them MAGA or whatever and had a family member sell them on the side.  I would have thought that would be good, but no, he didn't do it.

lwt5bsh,1gpth9g,lurowene,"I would never expect Reddit to have an unbiased take on a competing platform, but as someone who uses both, I can say that what drew me to Reddit in the first place is what currently draws me to Tik Tok. It’s the fresh stream of memes and the fast pace at which they evolve and disseminate throughout the platform. That’s what Reddit used to be for me 10 years ago. That’s why I joined. 

I have no loyalty to Tik Tok as a brand, but I enjoy the platform for the speed at which memes evolve and spread. I also think that a lot of its criticisms are fairly applied. It has a negative impact on your attention span, it probably doesn’t use your data for the most noble of causes, the Tik Tok shop (temu) is full of garbage, and it’s easy to spread misinformation and keep large groups of people uninformed. But what social media platform can you not say any of those about? 

In my opinion it’s far superior to Facebook, and roughly equivalent to IG Reels. But Instagram is an actual meat market OF funnel site at this point. 

Regardless of how it’s being politicized or what x candidate / politician said about it, I would be sad to see it gone, and left with only IG reels and fucking godawful Reddit mobile app left for entertainment. 

Not to mention Reddit has an aging population, and after a certain point in most people’s life (mid to late twenties) you become increasingly distrustful of new ideas. So it’s not exactly surprising to see a bunch of circlejerk redditors laughing at the same reposts, be anti-TikTok.

The Russian economy has experienced growth in both GDP and real wages after the initial hit. The real wage growth has led to a not insignificant increase in tax revenue and consumer spending (though consumer patterns are different). The appropriation of industries and companies tied to the West also led to a soft redistribution of wealth, though Putin is looking to re-privatise. 

The biggest worry is that the real wage growth is driven by a labour shortage, and they did recently ramp up their interest rates even further, so it is not like everything is fine and dandy.

Now he's not going to reverse it for the right reasons; it's all about the corruption. But Tiktok never needed to be banned. Robust consumer privacy protections needed to be put in place that apply to *all social media*.

The fact Tiktok was singled out was simply to try and force a sale into US hands/to curtail evidence of Israel's genocide because America didn't like not being on control of the ""propaganda"" on such a massive platform.

I eat downvotes for bringing this up in this sub every time I do and I don't give a flying fuck. People need to wake the hell up to the reality of what this ban was and quit gargling on the admin's BS excuses.

And of course, just to be clear: Trump is poised to have the most corrupt US government in modern history and every one of his policies is a fresh new hell for dismantling this country's government, crashing our economy, and dolling everything out into the hands of oligarchs in a disaster capitalism fire sale.

lwu2f9q,1gpth9g,jabberwockxeno,"I hope that this doesn't suddenly make everybody think banning Tiktok is a good idea or will do anything.

The idea that Tiktok has any more privacy issues or is more prone to Propaganda then other social media apps or platforms just because it's tied to China is horribly naive, especially because if you don't live in China and *especially* if you live in the United States, then there's a lot more of a risk for the data that Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc harvests actually being used against you 

It's not like China is going to fly police across the planet and arrest me in the US. people here in the US HAVE been arrested or harassed [for being critical of local police](https://kansasreflector.com/2023/08/11/police-stage-chilling-raid-on-marion-county-newspaper-seizing-computers-records-and-cellphones/) or from [spying on people's digital records to see if they got an abortion in states where that is no longer legal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/07/03/abortion-data-privacy-prosecution/)

Similarly, Insurance companies [spying on people via drones](https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/home-insurance-aerial-images-37a18b16) to find excuses to drop coverage or their online records to sniff out if they have prexisting medical issues is something I need to worry about from US corporations, not Chinese ones. Or, as another example, see [this article](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/data-brokers-trump-tech-spying-privacy-threat-1234897098/) Which had Rolling Stone Reports track people down to their exact location with a precision of just a few feet via ""anonymized"" advertising data from Google, Facebook, etc

If you're gonna argue that Chinese corporations can collect data and sell it to US ones, well guess what, it works in reverse: Google, Facebook, etc sell your personal data to China, so banning Tiktok etc won't actually do anything to prevent China from getting your data. 

If you and everybody else really cared about protecting people's data, we'd pass robust privacy protections that aren't app specific but are universal, including in regards to domestic corporations like Google and Facebook, which would allow people to decline the collection of their data by ALL apps, programs, and services, without being blocked from using said things if you decline, and banning the Third Party Doctrine so every time a company wants to share your data to another one, they have to explictly ask your permission for each instance, and regardless of if you've said yes already earlier in the chain of it being shared.

The focus on Tiktok and TEMU is just protectionism for US apps that are just as bad with spying, and because US legislators [dislike the political activism there, as many of them have admitted.](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/lawmakers-tiktok-ban-pro-palestinian-content-1235016101/)",5,2024-11-13 05:29:01,0.0743554,t3_1gpth9g,0,406

I was a Director of Sales at a startup and was tasked with picking our CRM by the founders. I shopped it down to Hubspot and Salesforce. We had an exploratory meeting, a follow up clarification meeting, and then a presentation meeting for pricing for services. Hubspot opened their meeting with a list of services based on our needs and a price. The salesforce team was a 3 person team and for 30 minutes, kept telling me they couldn't tell me the actual cost until onboarded. I still don't even know what that means typing it years later. Needless to say, I went with Hubspot and then went again with Hubspot at my next role as a VP of Sales. Those salesforce reps killed the sale. I wanted the data and they wanted to move me through some predetermined sales script.

So, AI may do better in a lot of cases where we just need the data and clarification questions about what's possible and how it integrates with our current tech stack (all things AI would excel at).",12,2024-11-13 05:47:48,0.0111111,t1_lwtg00z,0,207

1. [Jeff Yass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Yass) owns 75% of Susquehanna International Group (SIG).

2. SIG owns *at least* 15% of ByteDance, the TikTok parent company.

3. ByteDance has been recently (within the past year) valued in private deals at $220-268 billion (I'll say $244 billion for this example), so SIG's stake is >=$36.6 billion.

4. This valuation has been tempered by TikTok's scrutiny by US regulators, state governments, federal legislators, and the White House. Getting these political pressures removed would boost ByteDance's valuation significantly.

5. Yass [met with Trump in Palm Beach, FL on March 1, 2024](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trumps-tiktok-ban-reversal-after-meeting-megadonor-stake/story?id=108013785) at a conference for Club for Growth, a right-wing business-focused political advocacy group.

6. Within a week [\(on March 7th\)](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/09/tiktok-ban-trump-republicans), Trump completely publicly reversed his stance on TikTok.

7. Jeff Yass [donated at least $96 million](https://www.opensecrets.org/outside-spending/top_donors) towards helping to elect Trump and Republicans in the 2024 election cycle, making him the 6th largest donor on record as of federal filings through October 26.

I personally really like the block function (it's much stronger than in Twitter) and the detach quote function (basically you can detach yourself from any quote post people put you in, especially useful if someone quote tweets you looking to farm interactions off of drama or just being offensive towards you). In general on the emerging BSky culture there's a big emphasis on trying to avoid the pitfalls Twitter fell into even before Musk: interactions farming, drama farming, fake news, low-effort content, grifting, etc.

There's also flexible feeds: I have the basic chronological one (you can customize if you want to see only posts or also replies or even also likes), the basic algorithmic one (which you can delete if you don't want algos), but I've added like 10 more that I occasionally check: you can have feeds for your mutuals, for your followers, for the quiet posters among the people you follow, but most importantly for me heavily customized feeds made by other users or yourself. Just like with Reddit there's many days where I'm only in BSky for a few minutes and I have a feed I made myself which is basically a list of like 10 accounts whose stuff I don't wanna miss out. Then I have other feeds made by other users which focus on more specific stuff I'm interested in, like pixel art and sci-fi literature.

I also like the moderation lists. Some people curate dynamic ""blocklists"" to which you can subscribe with two clicks and you will automatically not see content from anyone that is in or gets added to that list. As long as you trust the curator to be rigorous they're amazing. There's blocklists for NFT and crypto propagandists, AI shills, spambots, scammers, content scrapers (those accounts that on Twitter steal images or content from other accounts in order to farm followers and later either sell them or push disinfo/political points) and people keep creating moderation lists for a lot of stuff (many use basic coding, like e.g. the other day I saw one that automatically adds anyone that has MAGA or TRUMP 2024 in their bio).

EDIT: I forgot to add there's an absolutely clutch setting to help make the Internet more friendly to blind and sight-impaired people: you can make it so a setting forces you to include ALT text in the images you upload. I say ""forces"" but for most people that do want to use ALT text but tend to forget about it works as a reminder",27,2024-11-13 09:06:20,0.110256,t1_lwubsxu,0,423

The main ways that is an issue isn’t by how locked down you secure the system or protocol that has the service you have but rather how one can take advantage of it.  A simple vulnerability can easily make that “locked down system” an easy target to gain access to. That’s why I have zero ports open and only use ways in that are more like reverse proxies and such.  Then I have layers of security that protect me even in those cases.

But home networks are ripe for zombies and command and control systems that if they can find a way in, they have another minion to do their biddings.  There have been DDOS attacks against many a company over the years using home systems because think about how a dispersed attack can be done if you have thousands of users with their own bandwidth they can use to crush a target.  It’s crazy but imagine 10,000 users each with broadband connections of 100mb to 1gb or faster connections attacking a volumetric attack against  company with 100gb pipe to the internet.

That's why you should set rules or use additional plugins to add additional functionality to the proxy. Like fail2ban, geoip blocking, some rules to disallow access to the admin page (no access to /admin from external as example). You can also add those to the Webserver.

Best way is to use a proxy with said rules and an IPS before that. If you go the usual way (SSL to proxy, http to service behind), you can also add an IPS/intrusion check between the service and proxy. Because of the missing encryption, it can even filter the data stream. IMHO better as MIT as decryption.

If the network behind is separated as it should be and the service itself is also locked down - like nextcloud snap - it also improves the security even more.

And the best - don't use external access without VPN if possible. VPN is setup fast in any phone. And you can use it just for your services you want to access, doesn't need to be for the whole network.
At least for a homelab that's a working solution. For anything else... Well - there's a reason security techs are paid well :D",1,2024-11-13 21:20:10,0.144722,t1_lwwxj9x,0,250

For news outlets, journalists, and users on the website, twitter was a good way to fire off, and share quick snippets of live news to a big audience, and they could follow up with an article afterwards. 

Makes sense to me as there is already an audience there for those types of things. There are programs and other websites that help you aggregate tweets so you could be a timeline of events easily too.

It was MUCH better before it became what it is today.

Saying ""I was able to do this and so can you!"" Leaves out the hundreds of millions of circumstances that got them to that point. It could be as simple as a chance encounter with a former colleague or luck or prior knowledge. But there are things another person could not replicate and those maybe are the exact things holding them back for one reason or another that isn't even in the realm of their fault. 

Can someone learn something to better themselves by reading how someone else made it, sure, can it inspire them, absolutely!

But there's only so much time in a day and those easy 5 minute hacks really stack up when you take a step back to realize what they are actually asking that most people just don't have the time, money, knowledge or skill to accomplish. 

So sadly most people are stuck where they are not because they did something wrong or didn't try hard enough but just because life happened and they made the choices they made, good or bad, at that moment. 

It doesn't mean they should abandon all hope or stop dreaming big but lying to people that 'anyone can do or be X' is also harmful. Kids need to hear that so they can try their best and hopefully work towards goals because there's a 0.001% chance they can be an astronaut but really maybe that makes them interested in science and that helps them unlock a talent they otherwise would not have found.

The protection service is both extraneous and unconstitutional, anyhow.

Furthermore, the Supreme Court has expressly noted that ""absent a special relationship between the police and an individual, no specific legal duty exists"" for Americans to be individually protected. The President has no such special relationship; in fact, the Supreme Court specifically exempted the President from portions of the criminal justice system that apply to the rest of Americans, so the exception clause holds even less meaning for the President than it does for all other Americans.

lwyul5d,1gqdlq5,CV90_120,">After watching the whistling diesel YT video on the truck though i just don’t know what kind of longevity these trucks will have.

Me neither. I feel like this vehicle is something that has a niche of it's own. Like you kind of know it's not going to be used like a truck for most buyers, so I'm guessing that for a few years at least (till it filters down through the used market), it will just be towing jet skis. As fun as it is watching people break them, we know that people mostly don't do what we see in those videos.

from what it sounds like, the secret service is arguing that:

- users agreed to let the apps on their phones track their location 
- the SS uses a program (called Locate X) which is basically just a service that purchases this location data from these apps and then aggregates it/provides a nice UI to search it
- the SS now has the right to use this data without any further permission from the user and/or a warrant

that's like saying if you give a locksmith your house key to make a copy of it, you also agree to let the local police have a copy and use it whenever they feel like it since you consented to giving it to the locksmith and therefore have no further right to privacy on it. absolutely bonkers.",50,2024-11-14 01:15:41,0.12013,t3_1gqbil8,0,139

They quote Carpenter v.

The best argument I saw was the national security one which was specifically mentioned as exclusion to that case(that and emergencies).

From page 1, very first paragraph, ""*The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (Vehicle Safety Act), NHTSA’s organic
statute, creates a self-certification system of compliance, in which vehicle and equipment
manufacturers certify that their products meet applicable standards.*""

2nd sentence: ""*NHTSA chooses vehicles
and equipment from the fleet to test for compliance, and pursues enforcement actions when the
Agency finds either a non-compliance or a defect posing an unreasonable risk to safety.*""

Now a quick search of ""why has nhtsa not chosen cybertruck to test for compliance?"" gives an article from [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/cars/car-safety/some-cars-will-never-be-crash-tested-crash-test-ratings-a9250800738/) stating, ""*IIHS spokesperson Joe Young told CR that the group focuses on the most popular vehicles. ""Our budget for crash testing vehicles is limited so we try to target big sellers. For example, neither NHTSA nor the IIHS have plans to test the Cybertruck. ""While it has certainly created a lot of buzz, it’s unlikely we would invest resources to test it unless it we're selling in numbers comparable with other popular large pickups,"" Young says.*""",4,2024-11-14 01:41:50,0.163605,t1_lwx5tfa,0,172

I love having to spend my time on hold to get insurance companies to follow their own contracts.

Anecdotally, I know multiple people who have had trouble with insurance blanket denying every single auth request regardless of place/service/specialty. United Healthcare is absolutely the worst about this but they all seem to be doing it to some degree. A lot of people and providers don't bother fighting denied auths so if your system autodenies every first request then the company is going to save millions (while burdening overworked doctors and staff who already have to spend more time on bullshit bureaucracy than medicine, all while reimbursement gets less and less and operating costs skyrocket).",169,2024-11-14 01:46:07,0.0147392,t3_1gqlf8e,0,191

Again no ports open, nothing on the WAN that's forwarding in.

If Trump puts tariffs on goods coming from those countries it will raise  the cost of those goods. If we decide to manufacture those goods here, the cost will go up, because the labor is not as cheap. I’m saying there is no benefit to these tariffs and they will cause inflation and make the dollar less valuable.",1,2024-11-14 02:53:01,-0.0187302,t1_lwz7oyn,0,174

Eh, sure. I didn't say that corners wouldn't be cut. What I said is I don't think those particular catastrophes will result. I'm obviously being somewhat pedantic, because u/Exostrike's examples were hypothetical (and a bit hyperbolic) I think the difference with Musk is that ""making money"" isn't the goal. He has legit things he's trying to accomplish, and he don't let things compromise the product. Tesla is a little different because the goal of making electric cars economically viable with a wider audience was the point, and he's pretty much accomplished that.

With SpaceX, his goal is to get to Mars. If he has a choice of spending more to increase the likelihood of success rather than spend less, compromising that likelihood just so the number in the budget can be bigger, well, that's not really him.

Cyber Trunk has serious issues, but his gigacasting is new tech. That was the point. Giga Casting is not the cheapest way to build a product (yet), but it *will* enable an entirely new era of manufacture that ultimately will become cheaper, and more reliable, in the future.

>The lack of environment regulations, lead to famines \*when the environment can not sustain our \*productive wants,

Is that what you think the cause of the Holodomor was?

>The regulation is to keep from tipping that scale into famine.

What you're talking about is called the Tragedy of the Commons. And yes, that was literally the progenitor of government. But what you're arguing is that large government in someway protects the populace simply because it's large, which completely misses my point. My point was the size of the government has no bearing on its ethics. That the claim that ""more regulation good"" is at best myopic. Is some regulation needed? Obviously (you just tangentially referenced the Tragedy of the Commons). But regulations existing in and of themselves doesn't mean they're good.

You want an example? Fluoride. In many regions in the US, fluoride is required to be added to the water. And before you conclude that I'm some crazy anti-vaxxer, listen to why: Fluoride binds to calcium. Osteopetrosis increased significantly when flouride was added to the water. Regulation for the sake of regulation is not a good thing.

You're literally arguing that the mere existence of a regulation is self-justifying. That no argument for *why* a regulation is beneficial and thus is needed. It's bureaucracy for bureaucracies sake.",-1,2024-11-14 03:27:38,0.138098,t1_lwz7o9r,0,442

Might want to get yourself a flip phone that you can take the battery out of.     Leave it home when you can.    What we did back in the day was to say things like ""I'll pick you up at 7"" and then you went to the place at 7.  No need for a call with a little pre-planning and patience.  We need to re-nomalize that.     Used a map to find our way around.    Giving directions was an art.   

If the radio is on, if you can receive a call,  they know where you are.      If you turn your phone off with software, it might not be actually off.   

Might be inbetweens, like the Librem phone.  I've been toying with Mobian,  it'd be better if more people were into it or stuff like it.        The more you can do open source, the better.    Free as in speech.      I started with Linux in the Clinton administration too and it was a bit clunky for the first decade but now it is as easy as anything else, so, yeah it take a bit more initially, but if it gets widely adopted, it can get better.

lx01s73,1gqoojs,CellistOk3894,"First off they’re completely bloated. I had so little work to do for 2.5 years and it never really picked up. They kept saying “it’s gonna get busy” but it never did. They have way too much staff who have redundant positions and there are meeting after meeting(some people will literally be in meetings the whole day), where almost nothing gets done. Then they have a meeting about a meeting. But when I asked if we can have a post mortem for a project so we can tweak the efficiency of a project, I’m told “we will have one for sure”. But then the next project comes up and no postmortem happens you kinda just don’t give af anymore.    

Second, they hire cheap talent from overseas and there’s lots of issues with communication and responsibility in roles.   

 Then the worst part, which surprisingly wasn’t the pay, was the lack of innovation. They’re supposed to be a tech company at the forefront of innovation but they have zero space for new ideas.  It’s a bunch of old people who are set in their ways. They think they still know best and won’t listen to research, focus groups or their customer. There is an acceptance of mediocrity across the board and when someone tries something new it’s met with pretty heavy resistance.  

My whole time there I felt line I was riding a sinking ship but the remote work and lack of actual work allowed me to freelance on the side easily. So I kept it. When the freelance worked dried up last year I was already planning my exit route but that’s not so easy in tech atm. Then they dropped me. No animosity at all. Not a horrible place to work if you wanna work in a staid office job but not a very satisfying experience, which is sad because they have so much potential.    

Edit: they’ve also been reshuffling talent and moving them around. They were so late to AI and have been scrambling to play catchup. If I had to guess they’re laying off admin staff, marketing and sales jobs. They’re def trying to shift into  AI and data centers and don’t give af about gaming AT ALL.

As shit as it is, laying off from the bottom or middle can mean a temporary strategic shift, which when you’re very heavily invested in extremely expensive projects (like Intel’s new fab) makes much more sense. As for AMD, they need as much development budget as they can get right now, as they need to pick up in the AI space and their Radeon lines. I don’t see any detail regarding the departments targeted by the lay offs in the article, so this could be freeing up cash to put towards those. 

Also, while trimming a thinner, higher cost layer of staff may seem better, it means you can often see much more of an impact to operations while cutting a much smaller number of people. As shit as it is, laying off lower level staff introduces *much* less instability than changing upper management at companies this size.

lx06he8,1gqeosd,PennethHardaway,"Some advice you didn’t ask for, but it’s my profession and I can’t help it sometimes lol:

In general, when follower counts go up, engagement may take a dip. It’s why follower count is not a solid enough metric to measure success. You will generally see higher engagement rates on mid-sized accounts because the audience tends to be full of more people who actually enjoy the content, and it hasn’t been flooded with people who engage once, follow, and never take another action. It’s why engagements are much better for gauging success.

Idk if this is the case for Blue Sky yet, haven’t jumped to the platform. I would theorize that a large number of your active engaged audience followed you over and are continuing to engage with your content. Thats the audience you want to keep around. I bet your engagement rates will continually be higher on Blue Sky for a while.

I would focus on continuing to build your Blue Sky base while keeping the lights on at Twitter, but actively encouraging your base to follow you over to Blue Sky. Doing so should bring over your most engaged audience members to help boost total engagements my friend. Happy posting!",11,2024-11-14 05:26:58,0.142216,t1_lwz4aki,0,202

Regarding the federation part, it's seriously ridiculous how many people acted like it was a complicated process that an average person can't do, all you had to do was go to their website and pick one of the biggest severs they list on top, the general widely used servers.

———-

The project was born out of the company’s 2020 acquisition of Wisconsin-based startup bluDiagnostics, the sources said.

BluDiagnostics was founded in 2015 by Weibel, Katie Brenner and Jodi Schroll, all of whom joined Grand Challenge. The startup had developed a thermometer-like device, called FertilityFinder, to help women track their fertility from home by testing their saliva and measuring two key hormones, estradiol and progesterone. The results of the test were viewable through a corresponding app.

Business Insider reported on aspects of the fertility device in 2022, when its codename was Project Tiberius.

The team was working to develop its own saliva collection device and mobile app, which could predict when a user might be in the fertile window. Users could also log their period symptoms, sexual activity and other data to assist with tracking their fertility. There are similar offerings on the market from companies including Inne, Oova, Ava and Mira, along with fertility and ovulation tracking apps such as Flo, Clue and Max Levchin’s Glow.

Amazon initially aimed to release the product this year, but the timing was pushed out after the team encountered technical issues with the device, one of the people said.

If you mail a package via UPS no warrant is needed to open the package up mid transit and then close it back up.

An inverter (in its name) converts it's DC input into an AC output by inverting the DC signal at a set frequency. The inverter changes the battery's DC power into AC power which is assumedly used for AC drive motors.

My guess is that the inverter is failing therefore the motors get no power/torque. They definitely 'forgot' to stress test all of their components because Musk knew his government influence would land him sales through subsidies and a smoke and mirror show.

That's why we tolerated their breaches of our sanctions more than we do China, to the point that they became Russia's 2nd largest exporter of restricted techs. It is a calculated compromise as we cannot afford to lose them as a key ally.

Militarily, India is a member of the Quad alongside only two other allies (Japan and Australia) to contain Russia and China. India is set to host the next Quad Summit as well - [India to host Quad Summit 2025, Donald Trump to represent the US](https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/india-to-host-quad-summit-2025-donald-trump-to-represent-the-us/ar-AA1tChTm)

[AI in India gets a boost as Microsoft, Amazon invest billions in data infra](https://www.business-standard.com/technology/tech-news/ai-in-india-gets-a-boost-as-microsoft-amazon-invest-billions-in-data-infra-124061800328_1.html).

This is an important geopolitical aspect of the current decade to contain the current adversaries, not unique to the US, though. Australia, for example, a co-member of the Quad, was relatively silent about the expulsion of a nest of Indian spies but was loud and even prosecuting spies from Russia, China, etc. [Australia sidesteps reports it expelled Indian spies](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-68925712)

I guess people complaining that things don't last just didn't do their research. /s

It's not that simple anymore. 80% of research time is wasted on reviews talking about the color of a thing, or ""how great it looks"".
Then there is tons of complaining about flaws, but those get rebutted with ""isolated case"" or questioning the review outright.

People buy crap all the time, because some marketing or other, or people they falsely trust told them it was great.

Trying to find out which GPU's are actually easy to clean or make dissassembly of those parts hard or easy is not something that you can easily research for instance. It just never comes up.
But the awesome LED rainbow  that I don't even want. That's everywhere. And good luck getting data on ""it dying in 2 years because they used the cheapest condies they could find. That even changes from revision to revision, so the research you are doing is basically on a different card, but you wouldn't know it unless for some reason the reviewer pasted the exact serial number, and YOU would be able to know whether something changed since then (was (is) a HUGE issue with SSD drives when they change chip provider between runs). If you are an early adopter, chances are you are effed. If you wait you might get cheated by using crap components later and no research indicating that.

No. Most people don't do that kind of research. And marketing tells them to go with their gut all the time. So they do.

Acting like people only buy shit products because they are really into the shit qualities is a bit ....  imaginative ....",1,2024-11-14 10:32:25,0.162903,t1_lx1g3o7,0,286

I'm so confused by people who think they can delete part of the internet by deleting an app on their phone.

Twitter/X are links.  You don't need a login (or app) to see them.  They are hyper links.  Deleting your twitter/X account has zero effect on the links.  All web browsers can view the links without an account, without an app.

If you want to view a Twitter/X link, click on it.  If you don't want to view a Twitter/X link, don't click on it.  It's a very simple concept.  This isn't an either/or sort of thing.  You don't need to choose a side.  It's a link.

There is this mentality that you have to choose your team: XBox vs Playstation.  Choose one.  The choice is totally obvious, and in front of everybody: both.  The idea of arguing about team sports is ridiculous, the whole point of URLs was ""Uniform Resource Locators"" that didn't require you to choose a team.  Bluesky is good, Twitter is a URL to content, Facebook is a URL, reddit is a URL, you don't need to choose a side.

What likely is going on is some sensor goes bad, or some measurement goes out of range, or some other edge case is causing their system to enter a critical fault state. Aka, “this device reports xyz, oh shit! Turn off, now!” And suddenly the vehicle goes limp.

Still a massive failure, but out of all the things to be overlooked in electrical architecture, sensors and edge cases are the most common.

FYI - Bolide and superbolide mean Bright and Very Bright, respectively, referring to brightness of the objects as they burn up on re-entry. Superbolides can be bright enough to turn night to day for an entire region while burning up.

Also, the damage in Megatons (million tons of TNT) is useful to draw comparisons from. the Hiroshima bomb was 0.015MT and the Nagasaki bomb was 0.021MT. A Megaton-level strike is like a nuclear strike in terms of devastation but with no radiation involved.

The larger, further objects discussed in this article will not impact Earth this time around. However, they will be affected by Earth’s gravity in such a way that it makes them riskier in the future. We’ll have to monitor them long-term to see exactly how their orbital paths are altered and re-evaluate their risk levels.

Unfortunately, asteroids give off no light and they become invisible to us for long periods of time, so this is harder than it sounds to monitor.

Bollocks.  There is a [very large number of observatories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Astronomical_observatories_by_country) (thousands, if you look at the subcategories) and this ignore amateur observers which is in the millions.

NASA might very well be the first to find an object, but there's no chance it wouldn't be picked up by others.

I also highly doubt that the find of an asteroid would be a secret inside NASA - astronomical data is typically shared widely and not considered at all secret.  Other groups than NASA can and do calculate trajectories; the first couple of articles for trajectory research I found with a Google search did not involve NASA at all; one of them was internationally led and the other one had international contributors.

1. The government can't be trusted to run the program efficiently. This is an acceptable reason for hesitation in my book, and there is nothing wrong with seeing a proof of concept or policy proposal before deciding (which gives people the benefit of the doubt that they would look at the policies and not blindly decide based on what news networks report).

  
2. Wait times would drastically increase to see doctors. This is the sad reason to me. Typically, a specialist already takes 3 months to see, and a regular doctor about 2 to 3 weeks. ER waits are atrocious at 2 to 10 hours in my experience with sick family members. They think that if we had universal healthcare, everybody can go see the doctor now and that increases wait time. So, we'd rather have certain people not be able to see the doctor and get preventative measures, or curb a problem before it becomes an ER visit? The responses I've got to this question is ""these people don't take care of themselves and become a burden WE have to pay for!"".

It can feel a little empty at first until you follow a few accounts, but once you get enough you can just scroll through the discover feed and look for more stuff you're interested in.

If the country I’m shipping from isn’t totally aligned with the country that imposed the sanctions they may be willing to work with the sanctioned country and make a deal to get them what they want. Enforcing sanctions is not easy. Idk why people would assume it was. Russia won’t just roll over and accept the West sanctions. They will be working their ass off to get around it. 

This also explains how some Starlink terminals got into Russia. It’s actually really hard to stop it. All they can do is make it harder which makes it more expensive. That’s still better than nothing as resources are limited.

I could imagine that diseases with strong ethnic background correlations could also be affected.

While there's no profit motive to deny care in a single payer world, there is a certain degree of rationing that can occur. Funding experimental care is difficult, particularly when it's very expensive and has a low likelihood of success.

We still have QA but since games are less a “fixed point in space-time” and more of a continually updated fluid entity, there’s less incentive to get it perfect on launch. 

And economically QA is considered a ‘cost center’ - something that drains money from your budget. Yes, there are indirect benefits, but the indirectness means it’s hard to quantify. Making less-buggy code is always the responsibility of engineering. QA ‘just’ finds and confirms bugs. An exec could just argue that the players can find and report bugs for free. So that’s pretty much how games (and major updates) are “tested”.

Infrastructure is crumbling, healthcare is awful, but the net wealth of those in government sure seems to be excessively high compared to the average person.

I don't understand. Why wouldn't Tesla be impacted along with all the others?

EDIT: To answer my own question, FTFA

\> Tesla has over the years been the biggest beneficiary of EV tax credits like the one in Biden’s IRA legislation, along with similar credits that preceded it. And yet it now may stand to gain from killing the subsidy because that could hurt rising EV competitors more than Tesla.

lx5nhsy,1grg9r4,SunshineAndSquats,"“A group of computer security experts have written to Vice President Kamala Harris to alert her to the fact that voting systems were breached by Trump allies in 2021 and 2022 and to urge her to seek recounts in key states to ensure election verification. 

Following the 2020 election, operatives working with Trump attorneys accessed voting equipment in order to gain copies of the software that records and counts votes. The letter to Vice President Harris argues that this extraordinary and unprecedented breach in election system security merits conducting recounts of paper ballots in order to confirm computer-generated tallies.  The letter also highlights the fact that the post-election audits in many key states will be conducted after certification and after the window to seek recounts closes, and that therefore recounts should be sought promptly. 

The letter states: “Possessing copies of the voting system software enables bad actors to install it on electronic devices and to create their own working replicas of the voting systems, probe them, and develop exploits. Skilled adversaries can decompile the software to get a version of the source code, study it for vulnerabilities, and could even develop malware designed to be installed with minimal physical access to the voting equipment by unskilled accomplices to manipulate the vote counts. Attacks could also be launched by compromising the vendors responsible for programming systems before elections, enabling large-scale distribution of malware.” 

“In December 2022 and again in 2023, many of us, concerned by the security risks posed by these breaches, wrote to the Attorney General, FBI Director, and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director outlining the security concerns and urging an investigation. Though there have been limited, localized investigations, there is no evidence of a federal investigation to determine what was done with the misappropriated voting software.”

The letter is signed by Professor Duncan Buell, Ph.D., Chair Emeritus — NCR Chair in Computer Science and Engineering, Dept. of Computer Science and Engineering, University of South Carolina*; David Jefferson Ph.D., Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory* (retired), Election Integrity Foundation*; Susan Greenhalgh, Senior Advisor for Election Security, Free Speech For People; Chris Klaus, Chief Executive Officer, Fusen World*; William John Malik, Malik Consulting, LLC*; Peter G.

The simple truth is that Tesla greatly accelerated the rollout and adoption of EVs. This is a good thing. That was partially due to subsidies (yes, partially). This is a good thing, the subsidies worked. Are we supposed to wait indefinitely until there's a company that surpasses Tesla so we can all be happy Elon is ""punished""?  

The original EV subsidy was designed to expire (based on vehicles produced by any given manufacturer, every manufacturer could've done it).  Everyone knew the rules, but only Tesla (+some others that failed) took up the challenge and were ""rewarded"" subsidies based on delivery of goods the subsidy was designed to subsidize! 

Then the subsidies were even extended/modified (as recently as IR act). 

To be clear, I think the subsidies/credits should be faded out gradually. Maybe I'm off and they should be extended for quite a while longer to compete with China, although, in general, I'm not in favor of protectionism.

2) Develop a specific malware that causes votes to be flipped or ignored

3) Copy malware onto USB or other medium

4) Have enough friendly election officials and gain physical access to voting machines to insert the USB. It can be self inserting code, so you only need to plug it in for a couple of seconds  and move on. 

Why this is unlikely is that all noting machines everywhere would need to be accessed. You would have to keep it to just a few dozen, or maybe 100 people. They could do this over a year, but with so few people accessing so many machines someone would have caught  it.

1) there is already an active investigation by the DOJ and they aren’t speaking about it until it progresses further (edit: I have no proof of this; just saying if there was an active investigation in its early stages, we would not be hearing about it yet).

2) a sitting VP investigating the election results after the election has already been called could be construed as a violation of executive power.

3) the optics of Harris interfering with a peaceful transition of power between the incumbent president and president-elect could undermine efforts to ensure peaceful transitions moving forward.

4) questioning the integrity of the electronic voting process could greatly undermine public trust (even further) and cause civil unrest, opening up more doors for foreign agents to sow discord.

5) any serious challenge to election results would ultimately end up in the hands of the SCOTUS, which would be… bad. The conservative majority would likely argue that  there’s no verifiable method or process in place to hold another election, so the election results stand. (Awesome. Legal precedent at the federal level for looser election certification process. Great.)

6) the disinformation campaigns and challenges from the now emboldened republican party would be massive and that would make it next to impossible to actually convince the public (and therefore representatives) to do anything about it. If nothing results from proof of election tampering due to bipartisanship, Americans (and the rest of the world) now have to contend with the fact that elections aren’t secure and our democracy is a sham. That is very not good for geopolitics, let alone national.



I’m positive this story will continue to develop and we will learn there was some level of election interference, but I suspect it will be from the media and not from the executive branch. Frankly, if there was any concern that the voting process was compromised, actions should have been taken ahead of the election. It’s the responsibility of the standing government body to ensure a fair election — detecting and investigating it after the fact is a failure of massive proportions. 

I want this to be investigated, truly, but the damage is already done. If there was voter fraud, is the new administration likely to do anything about it? Can the current administration do anything that won’t be repealed? Will the vast majority of the public even care, believe, and accept the news? No, no, and no.

Edit to get ahead of this: I’m just giving possible reasons why we haven’t heard anything from the Harris campaign or executive branch, and also why they may be hesitant to react quickly to this news. I don’t think these are necessarily valid reasons for avoiding the truth, as much as I think they are plausible reasons.

Many of you are right in pointing out that the GOP is just as guilty in sowing doubt in the election and the integrity of the voting process (amongst all of their other divisive tactics). Considering democrats have taken a staunch stance opposing claims that the voting process is compromised, it puts the Harris campaign in a very difficult situation. My hope is that whatever happens next is handled with caution and care — and that, if there are any issues, they are addressed in such a way that they can’t happen again.",3335,2024-11-15 06:07:56,0.067776,t1_lx60gto,0,579

If you read nothing else there, read the annual report. Really pressed for time? Read this one line:

'Only 1.4% of registered voters will vote in jurisdictions using
paperless voting systems in 2024.'

The better states do automatic sampled hand or machine-assisted recounts and compare them to the full machine count to see if there are discrepancies. For example California does this, it's part of why they take longer to certify an outcome. Would be great if every state did this.

A machine-assisted recount is when you use a machine (as stupid a machine as possible) to just sort the ballots by vote. It sorts them into piles. Then you measure/weigh/hand count the ballots in the piles.

You also take a look at a random sample of the ballots in each pile to see they indeed do have the votes on them which every ballot in that pile should have.

It's a faster and more accurate system than a full hand count. With statistical measures you can human-examine perhaps only 5% of the ballots and yet be confident the count was not rigged.

In a very close election (like a win by a single vote) there is no way other than counting every ballot (likely after a machine sort) to verify the outcome.",195,2024-11-15 07:24:32,0.165893,t1_lx5t1e6,0,262

lx6yvuf,1grg9r4,PerspicasiousGrue,"No, it was an actual breach. Georgia election officials invited Trump's campaign lawyers to an election site and allowed them access to the voting systems.

""Coffee County was specifically cited in draft executive orders for seizing voting machines that were presented to Trump on December 18, 2020, during a chaotic Oval Office meeting, CNN has reported. During that same meeting, Giuliani alluded to a plan to gain “voluntary access” to machines in Georgia, according to testimony from him and others before the House January 6 committee.

Days later, Hampton shared the written invitation to access the county’s election office with a Trump lawyer, text messages obtained by CNN show. She and another location elections official, Cathy Latham, allegedly helped Trump operatives gain access to the county’s voting systems, according to documents, testimony and surveillance video produced as part of a long-running civil lawsuit focused on election security in Georgia.

Latham, who also served as a fake elector from Georgia after the 2020 election, has come under scrutiny for her role in the Coffee County breach after [surveillance video showed](https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/20/politics/surveillance-footage-coffee-county-georgia-fake-trump-elector/index.html) she allowed unauthorized outsiders to spend hours examining voting systems there.""

Edit: And Colorado.

""Some of the facts in the case have never been disputed. Peters admits that in May 2021, she used the identity of a Fruita man named Gerald Wood to give a different man — Conan Hayes, a self-described data expert from California — access to county voting equipment, both to copy its hard drive and a few days later to attend a secure update of the machine’s software. Hayes is a retired surfer with ties to Lindell and his campaign of spreading falsehoods about the country’s election system. ""

Today we celebrate a new addition to the Global Tetrahedron LLC family of brands. And let me say, I really do see it as a family. Much like family members, our brands are abstract nodes of wealth, interchangeable assets for their patriarch to absorb and discard according to the opaque whims of the market. And just like family members, our brands regard one another with mutual suspicion and malice.

All told, the decision to acquire InfoWars was an easy one for the Global Tetrahedron executive board.

Founded in 1999 on the heels of the Satanic “panic” and growing steadily ever since, InfoWars has distinguished itself as an invaluable tool for brainwashing and controlling the masses. With a shrewd mix of delusional paranoia and dubious anti-aging nutrition hacks, they strive to make life both scarier and longer for everyone, a commendable goal. They are a true unicorn, capable of simultaneously inspiring public support for billionaires and stoking outrage at an inept federal state that can assassinate JFK but can’t even put a man on the Moon.

Through it all, InfoWars has shown an unswerving commitment to manufacturing anger and radicalizing the most vulnerable members of society—values that resonate deeply with all of us at Global Tetrahedron.

No price would be too high for such a cornucopia of malleable assets and minds. And yet, in a stroke of good fortune, a formidable special interest group has outwitted the hapless owner of InfoWars (a forgettable man with an already-forgotten name) and forced him to sell it at a steep bargain: less than one trillion dollars.

Make no mistake: This is a coup for our company and a well-deserved victory for multinational elites the world over.

What’s next for InfoWars remains a live issue. The excess funds initially allocated for the purchase will be reinvested into our philanthropic efforts that include business school scholarships for promising cult leaders, a charity that donates elections to at-risk third world dictators, and a new pro bono program pairing orphans with stable factory jobs at no cost to the factories.

As for the vitamins and supplements, we are halting their sale immediately. Utilitarian logic dictates that if we can extend even one CEO’s life by 10 minutes, diluting these miracle elixirs for public consumption is an unethical waste. Instead, we plan to collect the entire stock of the InfoWars warehouses into a large vat and boil the contents down into a single candy bar–sized omnivitamin that one executive (I will not name names) may eat in order to increase his power and perhaps become immortal.

All will be revealed in due time. For now, let’s enjoy this win and toast to the continued consolidation of power and capital.

Infinite Growth Forever,

Seems to me that if you've got 4ish years to plan and deep pockets it wouldn't be hard to get several people into each of the various companies that produce the software and hardware.

Use your other tech companies to poach key employees out of the target companies to create open positions, optionally build leverage (honey-trap or whatever) with the people involved in hiring to favor hiring of the highly qualified agents you send to interview (then optionally poach them to a sweet high-paying gig that they'll lose if they ever realize they were used and want to talk about it), then have the agents spend a couple years developing trust, exfiltrating the code, and providing details on whatever internal security measures they have in place. You don't really need insiders, but it can make things easier.

You could then plant malware designed by your experts in external dependencies used by the software (ES&S for example uses .NET, so quite likely they use a large number of packages downloaded from Nuget, and certainly nobody is doing detailed security reviews on all that code). If you can't compromise the public package source you could potentially compromise their network to inject your compromised versions (that requires some fairly sophisticated techniques to circumvent various network security practices, but with time and possibly some insiders it's doable).

Compromising the software at the source eliminates a lot of deployment complexity and risk.

However, if there is a paper ballot trail then tampering like that would be obvious when comparing hand recounts to machine tallies. So any software tampering, regardless of how it is done, would really only work well for all-electronic voting, which is why anyone who works with computers thinks that is a terrible idea.

I don't have a strong opinion on whether there was tampering, but I don't think that someone with time, billions of dollars, questionable ethics, and strong reasons to favor one candidate would have any insurmountable technical hurdles to pulling off a multi-state voting system hack.",5,2024-11-15 08:59:53,0.0353061,t1_lx5x91l,0,346

>>Symbolically speaking, this era was inaugurated by Chuck Hagel, an unknown millionaire who ran for one of Nebraska’s U.S. Senate seats in 1996. Initially Hagel trailed the popular Democratic governor, Ben Nelson, who had been elected in a landslide two years earlier. Three days before the election, however, a poll conducted by the Omaha World-Herald showed a dead heat, with 47 percent of respondents favoring each candidate. David Moore, who was then managing editor of the Gallup Poll, told the paper, “We can’t predict the outcome.”

>>Hagel’s victory in the general election, invariably referred to as an “upset,” handed the seat to the G.O.P. for the first time in eighteen years. Hagel trounced Nelson by fifteen points. Even for those who had factored in the governor’s deteriorating numbers and a last-minute barrage of negative ads, this divergence from pre-election polling was enough to raise eyebrows across the nation.

>>Few Americans knew that until shortly before the election, Hagel had been chairman of the company whose computerized voting machines would soon count his own votes: Election Systems & Software (then called American Information Systems). Hagel stepped down from his post just two weeks before announcing his candidacy. Yet he retained millions of dollars in stock in the McCarthy Group, which owned ES&S. And Michael McCarthy, the parent company’s founder, was Hagel’s campaign treasurer.

>>Whether Hagel’s relationship to ES&S ensured his victory is open to speculation. But the surprising scale of his win awakened a new fear among voting-rights activists and raised a disturbing question: Who controls the new technology of Election Night?

lx7gtp6,1grg9r4,CAStrash,"I don't think the election was stolen.

But trying to find ANYTHING at all about the security efforts made in the voting machine software.

There is so little transparency I can't even find out

1. If they used mandated access-controls on the Linux based ones. And how strict the configuration was.
2. Anything about their kernel configuration and hardware support, or the software even a simple bill of materials for the software.

There is nothing publicly stated that would give any idea to how much of an effort was put into securing the software.

I am hopeful USB support was yanked out entirely other than for whatever input method they use on the voting machines in the kernel configuration. As well as any hardware not used in the machine. As well as migration to have it configured to be monolithic with everything compiled in. (No kernel module support)

The windows based ones are even more of a mystery. And most disturbingly it seems they even run an anti-virus further increasing its attack surface. (OSET institute seems to be talking about the anti-virus on them in an article). The fact these can even run an anti-virus that would have a substantial amount of dependency's seems to indicate they didn't really strip down the windows embedded at all. It may even have windows explorer. It sure has more services than it would need to function.

I just get a trust us its secure marketing vibe to the point where its sickening.

I sent out to write a post about why it couldn't have been tampered with and provide details as to measures taken.... Only to find that the only security that is public seems to be that there is a lock on the units and possibly tamper tags.

I hope future elections decide to add some transparency to the voting machines security.

edit: Looking into them more, The Dominion ones seem pretty sketchy too these ones seem to run windows from what little I can find.

Even more so the fact someone takes a USB flash drive to get the votes off the machine and runs it on a laptop off wifi. I wouldn't trust this process that much especially if CVE-2024-30078 windows security patch wasn't applied. Its not that inconceivable that someone could make the machines they tally the votes if they were in wifi range, and they reverse engineered the software. (With no trade being left after they reboot).

That exploit is particularly troubling since a forged management frame (unencrypted part of wifi you don't have to be connected too to forge). Can be used to execute a custom payload in kernel space. Without anything ever needing to hit the disk if it was specially crafted.   
  
All an attacker would need to do is have a high gain directional antenna in a van and cycle through all channels repeating it a few times then leaving. (Assuming they had a copy of the software that totals the votes). 

The stuff on the USB drive is supposed to be encrypted but that sure won't help once its decrypted in ram.

Also Colorado had all of the windows passwords apparently leaked online for the Dell Latitude 3490's they do this on.

I hope they tally every paper vote off every machine in each election.

Trump probably was onto something going after Dominion. I don't think the election was stolen him either.   
But I sure ask heck wouldn't trust the count on its own the night they announce the winner.

At least not until someone has gone through all the paper votes months later to confirm an accurate count off the audit trail.",5,2024-11-15 09:23:40,0.114277,t3_1grg9r4,0,609

I have a timeline full of space photos, posts about my sports teams, pics of sunsets/nature/dogs/cats, art, fiction authors just yapping away, and not nearly as much division and arguing (yet). There are still some of those political accounts that would say the same things they say on twitter, but they don’t seem to dominate the platform all that much and tbh I kinda want it to stay that way even though I know it probably won’t forever. 

Still, more pleasant and relaxing form of social media compared to the other dominant ones on the market today.

Edit: Okay you fuck mothering cynical dipshits, I am not a bot, I have not been paid, this is no Bluesky promotion or anything. My Reddit account is 11 years old and I am someone that just genuinely wanted to have social media for entertainment and not rage engagement and arguments. 

I’m just someone who liked twitter in the past because of funny shit and sports posts and the occasional early release of news on basic things and the last couple of years it’s turned into a spam bot filled cesspool of conservative/right wing echo chamber, paid verified blue check accounts that artificially promote whatever unpopular opinion they have, etc. I’m tired of the engagement rage bait that we see on threads too, and I just don’t see that stuff on BlueSky so I thought I’d share with others. 

While some may not care, I don’t want to see OnlyFans content creators spamming the timeline, people using racial/disability/homophobic slurs with nothing being censored or moderated. I’d like to have certain things filtered out that I don’t want to see, and I like having websites that isn’t a goddamn Trump ad or crypto scam every other fucking post. If that’s your jam then go for twitter you’ll love it but some of us fucking don’t. The media will constantly shove politics down our damn throats one way or another and BlueSky just happened to be a place that, to me personally, felt like tumblr, Reddit, and twitter did back when I first started using these platforms a decade ago. 

Disagree with me if you like, maybe you don’t like the user base or UI or style of posts there or hated what twitter and stuff tried to be, whatever that’s fine. But quit calling me a a fucking bot or astroturf account or BlueSky promotion because I ain’t getting paid a goddamn cent for this post just like I’ve never been fucking paid for any of my social media use, I just use it for FUN to ESCAPE a little from the day to day bullshit of life like we all want to do with our entertainment.",876,2024-11-15 10:29:33,-0.0281617,t3_1grnx2q,0,467

Wasn't that just Konami/Ultra? I got the impression they received special treatment because their output was so genuinely good that NoA wasn't concerned about them dumping shovelware onto the platform. Which was the real point of the limitation.

Kinda like how Sony bent a lot of their rules to let Crash Bandicoot happen.

Although my personal favorite story along those lines was Sonic 3D Blast on Genesis. The devs (Traveler's Tales, now TT Games) had a rare crash bug that they could never track down, and they were worried about submitting to Sega QC. If Sega hit the bug, they'd demand it be fixed - but TT had no idea how to do it.

So they altered the crash handling to pop up a level select menu if the game crashed, complete with a ""congrats, you found a secret"" message. Talk about hanging a lampshade on it!",6,2024-11-15 11:23:48,0.136243,t1_lx7vu0z,0,157

lx8351w,1grg9r4,izomiac,"A decade or two ago pretty much every tech expert on Slashdot felt closed source black box electronic voting machines were intrinsically insecure.

When Trump lost and alleged there was fraud regarding the voting machines there was overwhelming sentiment on Reddit that voting machines are de facto 100% secure, and a lot of news agencies were sued for hundreds of millions of dollars for slander/liable by the voting machine companies for reporting on the story.

Now with Trump's victory we're back to voting machines being insecure, because they were audited four years ago.

Personally, I grew up in a county where the top players openly bought votes and committed other acts of election fraud in addition to openly breaking other laws without consequence (e.g. beating his wife in public for disobedience, shooting a neighbor in the back for ""trespassing"" to get to his land that they'd surrounded & landlocked away from the road).  Decades later [some were arrested by the FBI for it](https://www.kentucky.com/news/local/education/article44389119.html).  So I assume some degree of fraud happens, but the last few elections weren't close enough to have been flipped unless there was a massive conspiracy in multiple swing states, which would require a degree of secrecy that isn't plausible for the number of people that would need to be involved.  So I find both the prospects of there being zero fraud and of the election being stolen being laughable, though the political camps push one of those two narratives based on how they did in the election.",8,2024-11-15 12:07:41,0.00123457,t1_lx78zmq,0,251

Or, numbers do not match, but not because of malfeasance, but because of inadvertent human error, or failure of procedure, etc.  Many hand recounts produce a 1:1000 error rate, a very few  a 1:100 rate.  For this election, such rates are extremely unlikely to change the results.  Recounts for very close elections (say, <0.5% difference) should be done as a matter of course.  Those, and random recounts that confirm accurate results or very low error rates should increase public confidence in the vote casting and counting process.  We would like to have perfection, but we also rely on humans in the loop.",203,2024-11-15 13:13:14,-0.0433333,t1_lx7v2u8,0,112
lx8andl,1grg9r4,jbaker1225,"But in each of those states, Harris also got more votes than the Democratic candidate for Senate. So no, Trump voters didn’t have to vote for Democrats down-ballot for the numbers to add up.  

In Nevada, the incumbent senator won (incumbents have a huge advantage) with fewer votes than Harris got in the state.  

In Arizona, Kari Lake is not particularly popular among Republicans. She was polling behind in every serious pre-election poll in Arizona, despite the fact that Trump was polling ahead in Arizona in almost all of those same polls. We saw that reflected in the final results.  

In Pennsylvania, another swing state that Trump won, the incumbent Democrat lost, while earning 40,000 votes fewer than Harris. If Casey had been on as many ballots as Harris, he would have won re-election.  

So across the board, even Harris voters were not all voting for Democratic Senate candidates. Simply put, A LOT of people only vote for President or in certain races. With a candidate with a cult of personality like Trump, that’s probably even more likely.  

But nothing about the swing state results looks particularly fishy, especially when it was also reflected in the non-swing states. In states that Trump had no chance at winning, like New York and New Jersey, he made HUGE gains compared to his performance in 2020. In Florida, a state that was a Republican lock, he won in a landslide much bigger than expected. There would not have been any point in “cheating” the votes in those states that wouldn’t impact the election outcome, unless you want this conspiracy to get even larger and more unlikely.",7,2024-11-15 13:15:59,0.0966811,t1_lx7ns8k,0,273

lx8z1br,1grg9r4,levir,"Honestly, I don't get why you'd use voting machines at all. What does it get you?

In Norway we have standardized paper ballots, and all ballots are mandated to be counted twice. One of the counts have to be by hand. So in districts with many voters, you have machines that does a first scan of the votes to quickly get accurate numbers, and then all the votes are hand counted in a second round. Any ballots that may have been held in escrow (i.e. if there's a question about whether someone has the right to vote or has voted twice, their vote is placed in a separate sealed envelope until it can be properly decided whether it should be counted) are added to final count. Then the count, and eventually the election, is certified.

By having a paper ballot as the primary vote, you ensure that there's always a paper trail. We've also done voting with paper ballots for decades, and most of the ways to cheat are well known. Actually cheating requires getting the paper ballots into or out of sealed, verified envelopes in sealed, guarded ballot bins. Anyone is equipped to spot suspicious behaviour.

With voting machines, any problems can be completely hidden. There's no way for the voting citizen to verify that the machine is working correctly and reporting correct results. There's no obvious way for election officials to spot if the machine is behaving suspiciously. It's easier to fake or hide the paper trail.",3,2024-11-15 17:14:12,0.164846,t1_lx6k0c5,0,249

lx981yw,1gru637,NonEuclidianMeatloaf,"Both Rockstar and Grove Street Games are at fault here. GSG was a small studio full of mid developers that made crappy mobile shovelware as their day job, and had a hand in making flawed mobile ports of the original GTA trilogy. They had barely over 20 people at their disposal when remastering 3 massive fucking games. So what did they do? Ran assets through machine learning to upscale them, and plugged everything into UE4 the way one jams their dirty luggage into their suitcase at the end of their vacation. It wasn’t pretty, it didn’t play well, but it functioned.

Rockstar allowed this to happen. Competent management and oversight would’ve seen that this studio was completely unprepared and under-equipped for the task at hand. This job should’ve been headed by a studio an order or magnitude larger. But Rockstar figured that this remaster could be done for pennies on the dollar (either due to their own greed or GSG saying they could, the truth of which we may never know) and gave the green light.

GSG made a shitty port because that’s likely all a studio that size could possibly do under the circumstances. Rockstar put them in this position of failure.

lx9dtg9,1grwbo3,Wagamaga,"In the weeks leading up to the US presidential election, Kacey Smith was feeling hopeful. Smith, who supported Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign, says she knew it would be a close race between the Democratic nominee and Republican Donald Trump. But as she scrolled TikTok, she believed Harris would be victorious.

But Election Day approached, and she started to sense red flags in that positivity. She recalls TikTok serving her enthusiasm for reproductive choice with videos encouraging “women’s rights over gas prices” — implying, falsely, she thought, the choice was “either/or.” The rhetoric fit well inside her feed filled with strangers, but as a campaign strategy, it felt limiting and risky. “When I started seeing that messaging play out,” Smith says, “I started getting a little uneasy.” Her fears were borne out: Harris lost the popular vote and Electoral College and conceded the election to President-elect Trump.

  
Filter bubbles like TikTok’s recommendation algorithm are a common point of concern among tech critics. The feeds can create the impression of a bespoke reality, letting users avoid things they find unpleasant — like the real people in Smith’s life who supported Trump. But while there are frequent complaints that algorithmic feeds could serve users misinformation or lull them into complacency, that’s not exactly what happened here.

Full of men genuinely looking for slaves as wifes, full of unbelievably entitled women thinking men need to fulfill a massive list of demands while all they have to bring is a pretty face, men blowing up over women making totally rational requests, women critizising absolutely EVERYTHING a man could possibly do (NEW ICK UNLOCKED: MAN BREATHES) ... it's AWFUL and it's draining my mental.

The majority of people didn’t literally vote for the worst parts of Trump, they voted for literally any change at all. I understand why it’s still disheartening overall to have so many people unbothered by those worst parts of Trump though. Totally agree on that. I mean, you certainly have to also factor in sexism. Just rationally seems like a factor.

EDIT: just wanted to add that maybe there was a failure in messaging, but I know for sure that it is very difficult to explain to the average American that we have one of the best responses to inflation globally among the G7 nations.

Rockstar is utterly bulletproof to criticism at the moment, simply because of the success of GTA 5/Online. Could that change if 6 bombs? Sure, it likely could.

The point is I don't know how much Musk personally even had to spend, and that he was actually acting on behalf of numerous other parties, including foreign ones who stand to benefit from access and control of public discourse.

lx9q6or,1grwbo3,helmutye,"Yeah, not really. So *everyone* who uses an algorithmically driven site (ie just about everyone who uses the internet today) lives in a bubble. That is, the information they see is not designed to reflect reality, but rather maintain their attention.

Meanwhile, reality continues on its way, unconcerned with how people think about it. And whatever is going to happen happens.

After events like this there always seems to be this rush for people to try to act like they knew better than others, or to otherwise explain and thereby feel like they're exercising some level of control.

But they're not. The Republicans and other people who are pretending like they knew the whole time? They didn't know shit. They were making excuses right up until election day for why Trump was going to lose. Two years ago, Republicans were confident of a ""red wave"", only to then get trounced. They are wrong *all the time*. Just like everyone who tries to reliably predict how hundreds of millions of people are going to act based on a handful of surveys.

So don't take people seriously when, after the fact, they pretend like they knew. They didn't. They do not have any special powers that other people lack. Even if they made a claim in advance, there were two possible results in this election and up until the end most polls could not clearly predict a winner. 

Being able to guess a coin flip in advance doesn't mean a person has magic powers -- a person who only ever guesses heads or only ever guesses tails will be right about 50% of the time on a large number of guesses, but it is completely possible to get five or ten heads or tails in a row.

And political parties pretty much *always* claim they are expecting to win, because their chances of winning *definitely* go down if they tell people who haven't yet voted that they're probably going to lose.

It's okay to hope for a victory, and to feel sad if it doesn't happen. Because guess what? People who always predict the worst are *also* wrong all the time as well. People who make predictions *at all* are wrong all the time, because even people with a lot of expertise only understand a small portion of the totality of reality, because humans aren't that smart compared to the universe. We are getting smarter every day, but we're trying to fill an ocean one molecule at a time.

If there's a lesson to draw, it should be that we shouldn't hang our hearts on the outcome of things beyond our control if we can possibly avoid it. It's fine to hope for a Harris victory...but if you tied your sense of self to her winning, *that* was the mistake. Because no matter how invested you may feel, she doesn't know you nor really care about you beyond the degree to which her incentives align with yours. Also, you have almost no control over what happens -- you have your vote (a non-zero but still very small say) and your ability to influence people (which is very small, because most people don't know that many other people and because it's difficult to actually convince someone to change their mind).

Also, what exactly could you have done differently to prepare, had you known? Do you actually have the ability to move or leave the country or whatever? Because if not, you aren't really basing major decisions off of this outcome anyway...so who cares if you didn't guess the result? You're going to do the same stuff going forward either way!

Finally, we still don't have all the necessary information to even do a true lessons learned autopsy anyway. So everyone is just guessing at this point. It's worth asking these questions and learning the answers, because anything that helps you understand the world does help you live...but at this point you should probably be more focused on what you're going to do in the next year or two rather than what the Dems could do differently in 4 years, yes?",84,2024-11-15 20:10:26,0.0634363,t3_1grwbo3,0,687

As a North Carolinian in those areas, it was jam packed nonstop with Harris campaign ads on TV and radio. I never heard or saw Trump ads. I got plenty of mail spam, though. Same for Harris. Never had Trump campaigners come to the door or Trump campaign holding events outside of the couple times Trump or Vance came here. 


Harris’ campaign was extremely overbearing and I’m a registered Democrat that supported her campaign. She didn’t give up. She had an overwhelming presence in ads and redirected funds to run them in VA where they were presumably needed. But seriously; Harris not only outspent Trump on these ads, but Trump never was able to catch up with airing competing ads. 


So if that’s the metric of “giving up” clearly it didn’t matter much since she had a near monopoly on air time outside of rightwing radio and rightwing tv networks.",-20,2024-11-15 20:40:10,0.0876102,t1_lx9p8x2,0,329

Harris was generally more favored - just not on key issues like immigration and economy.

But ultimately that doesn't matter to voters since most aren't analysts or experts where this might be useful context.

When you read this investigation and see that it was a huge, bot and rule breaking, astroturfing swarm, it makes more sense as to why:

A) You couldn't escape these types of posts and comments.

B) As soon as the election was over, the posts and comments abrubtly stopped, and suddenly, more centrist and conservative viewpoints were visible because they weren't being massively blocked and downvoted at the scale of the tampering scheme.

And to everyone who wishes to reply, ""Well Elon owns X and does the same thing."" No, this is completely different. Search my comments for why. I'm not typing it out again.

Edit: If all you are going to comment is that the Federalist sucks, without reading the actual article, then I'd highly advise you to actually read the article. Take the time to read it before you comment. It's not that long. See if you still want to make the same comment after you read the article. That is all I ask.

lxalwsv,1grwbo3,stormy2587,"I have no idea how you would even evaluate information outside the “bubble” everyone accuses everyone else of being in. Anytime I wade into conservative media it’s always insane hyperbole and extremism. That doesn’t seem more useful to me. Conservatives were sure Trump was gonna win in 2020. There is never much useful information to gleam from those spaces. Polling data has been shit for 3 election cycles. The bigger issue seems like we don’t have good objective measures to gauge the electorate. 

Trump himself legitimately seemed concerned he would lose.  

Harris seemed to have momentum at least compared to biden. I think people felt optimistic about that, but most of what I saw on reddit was cautious optimism that things might break her way. 

I just don’t understand the hand wringing about “liberal media bubbles” what is the issue here? Just that it gives people false hope and now they feel bad? Why is that bad? Is there any data that people in these bubbles are less likely to vote? The article seems to interview someone who they tacitly acknowledge was very politically engaged despite being in her ""media bubble.""

It seems like the bigger issue is media bubbles other than liberal ones that provide centrists and conservatives with misinformation. Like the idea that a non-negligible number of people didn’t understand how tariffs worked or didn’t understand that biden was no longer running seems like the much bigger issue from a media bubble perspective.

Edit: basically why would it be useful to expose more people to misinformation from the right? Why is that useful for the average voter? Just because you might be less disappointed on election night?",1,2024-11-15 22:50:18,-0.00422824,t3_1grwbo3,0,279

In particular:

- personal data, even obfuscated to remove PII but that may be used to segment a user in any way, is the property of that user and may not be transferred or sold to another party without express consent of the user *every time*. There is no blanket opt-in.
- users may not be tracked between sites. A user cookie must not be accessible to a site unless that site is the one that made it.
- profits made from the sharing of user data must be shared with the owner of that data where 90% of the money made goes back to the user.
- algorithmic boosting based on engagement (clicks) or paid-for boosting is illegal. Full stop. ""What's hot"" and ""trending"" sections must cease to exist. Timeline-based feeds are the only thing permissible.
- every ad shown to a user must come from a list of interests the user has selected. If they have selected no interests, they will be shown no ads.

This will break social media, and in a big way, the internet as we know it. Ask me if I care. The damage algorithmic boosting and data gathering has done to society is enormous, and nothing short of draconian regulation against it can stop the cancer.

The entire purpose of the game is simply chasing money to buy the shiny thing.

lxaybs4,1grwbo3,CassandraTruth,"I read the article and found it to be exactly the opposite of what you and the title claims. It's not a bombshell revealing massive corruption and algorithm manipulation. It's just a very standard political messaging campaign, and you're an utter rube if you think the Trump  campaign didn't have any equivalent organizing. They just targeted different platforms and used actually illegal techniques.

From the article

*""Despite my fervent belief that something was amiss, I never had any direct proof that Democrats were actively manipulating social media.*

*That all changed two weeks ago, when X user @jessiprincey replied to one of my posts with a screenshot from a Discord server, seemingly related to the Harris-Walz campaign:""*

The writer admits they have an unfounded bias before the content even starts, and everything in the rest of the article comes from this one Discord group they heard about via tweet.

*""What I’d find there went far beyond algorithmic manipulation.""*

False, algorithmic manipulation would imply the Harris campaign or people sympathetic were controlling the system algorithms in Reddit's content sorting. In fact they find a campaign of users posting and sharing content, people that are not a part of Reddit operations using public means. It would be a more damning indictment if say the owner of Reddit had started a promoted a Harris supporting sub or was actually affecting the content sorting algorithms such that people get served content that is not as popular but aligns with the campaign.

*""I found their primary target to be r/Politics, the largest community on Reddit for discussing U.S. politics""*

Very nefarious to target the Politics board with your Politics messages.

*""I found that 126 of the top 1,000 posts in the past month on r/Politics were posted by official Harris-Walz campaign volunteers""*

**faaaart** Absolutely embarrassing rookie numbers from a billion dollar campaign. Honestly this is more an indictment of how ineffective their social media campaign was, you barely get 1/8th of the traffic of the one place you direct most of your attention? Elon is fucking laughing at this. 95+% of TV ad time was bought by political campaigns, if you lived in a swing state you saw back to back to back commercials this whole last week of the campaign.

*""For instance, a link about “how Project 2025 impacts reproductive health” will be directed towards communities with young women as their primary user base, whereas news about Kamala’s Fox News interview “winning over swing state voters” gets directed to Reddit’s Democrat communities, and possibly to people living in swing states.""*

Insidious, despicable, deplorable, this kind of Machiavellian campaigning should be illegal I tell you! Tie them up for using Babby's First Focus Group level tactics.

*""Kamala’s posters, however, don’t simply spam links haphazardly. They use a calculated, sequential post timing metric to avoid Reddit’s built-in spam filters. Harris-Walz campaign volunteers often discuss their ban-avoidance tactics in their Discord server, while continuing to spam Reddit with their collected links.""*

The ""calculated, sequential post timing metric"" being discussed is ""3/day, 20-30 mins apart"" by the way. If that qualifies as a calculated strategy then I guess I understand why the author is so terrified of this level of organization.

St Pauli have become the first major football club to leave X, ­describing the social media site as a “hate machine” and expressing concern that it may influence the outcome of the forthcoming German election.

  
The traditionally leftwing ­Bundesliga club have ceased ­operating their account and urged fans to [switch to Bluesky](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/nov/12/us-election-bluesky-users-flee-x-twitter-trump-musk), an alternative site whose user base is believed to have grown by about 750,000 in the past 24 hours. “Musk has converted X into a hate machine,” part of the club’s statement read.

I think there should be some civil law in place to protect people. Slander/libel laws could be expanded so that a person’s reputation is protected by threat of litigation. But at the end of the day, trying to make it criminal is criminalizing a type of art and creates a very slippery slope. It’s the dilemma of AI. Similarly with people using it to create underage sexualized material, there is no victim and is “art” (as sick as it is to us average people). If the government is able to pick and choose what can be art and cannot be art based on subject matter and realism, it opens the door for a government to censor other things that aren’t so black and white. What if a Trump administration wants to ban art that portrays Trump in a negative light? For example, the giant sculpture of a gross, fat, naked Trump. It should be protected under the first amendment, but when you create laws that allow the government some infringement of that right, they will not stop. 

And I want to add, I do not agree with deepfakes being used to deceive and sway elections, or AI to be used to create illegal types of pornography. I think both are despicable. I just see the flaws in trying to control these things, and how the laws could quickly grow into something that’s infringing on rights.",4,2024-11-16 00:29:43,-0.00248358,t3_1gs0kw4,0,303

Biden was a pragmatic choice, lots of ex gop said they’d vote for him, stay home for the other moderates, or hold their nose and vote for trump with the progressives.

You and your r/PersecutionFetish can take a hike. Words mean something. Hate speech is targeted harassment towards a person or people on the bases of things like orientation, skin color, and others. That’s all it’s ever been.

What would be super satisfying to me is if Xhitter's revenue got so bad they end up like MySpace and eventually had to shut down, then all the right wing trolls that will inevitably end up on BlueSky were held to all the same rules about hate speech they used to have on Twitter before Elon took it over, possibly implemented in such a way that would be more effective in shutting down misinformation.

I agree, but you'll need to be more specific than that. Old school forums used an ""algorithm"", too, where fresh comments would ""bump"" a thread back to the top of the page, and after a certain point it became impolite to ""necro"" an old thread (comment on an old post, dragging it back from the dead and to the forefront of the forum), so some would lock threads after a certain amount of time from the original post, don't after a certain amount of time without comments, others never at all (with mods handling cases of necro threads on a case-by-case basis)

Just asked ChatGPT 4o to create one. Results below:

Creating a tool to transfer the profiles you follow on Twitter to Bluesky and set up notifications when those profiles are detected involves several steps. Below is a guide on how you can create such a tool.


---

Disclaimer: Before proceeding, ensure that you comply with the terms of service and API policies of both Twitter and Bluesky. Unauthorized access or scraping of data may violate these terms and applicable laws.

1. Access Your Twitter Following List

Use the Twitter API:

Register for a Developer Account: Sign up for a Twitter Developer account to obtain API keys and tokens.

Authentication: Use OAuth 2.0 or OAuth 1.0a for authentication.

Endpoint: Utilize the GET friends/list or GET friends/ids endpoint to retrieve the list of users you follow.


2. Access Bluesky User Data

As of my knowledge cutoff in October 2023, Bluesky might have limited public API access. You'll need to:

Check for an API: Visit Bluesky's developer documentation or contact their support to see if an API is available.

Web Scraping (Not Recommended): Scraping websites without permission may violate terms of service and legal regulations.


3. Match Profiles Between Twitter and Bluesky

Matching Strategies:

Username Matching: Compare Twitter usernames with Bluesky usernames.

Email or Other Identifiers: If possible and compliant with privacy laws, use email addresses or other identifiers for matching.

Fuzzy Matching: Implement algorithms to match similar names, considering that users may have different handles.


4. Set Up Notifications

Notification Methods:

Email Notifications: Send an email alert when a match is found.

Push Notifications: If creating a mobile app, integrate push notifications.

In-App Alerts: Display notifications within your application interface.


5. Automate the Process

Scheduling:

Cron Jobs: On Unix-based systems, use cron jobs to run your script at regular intervals.

Task Schedulers: For Windows, use the Task Scheduler to automate the script execution.


6. Develop the Tool

Choose a Programming Language:

Python: Popular for scripting and has extensive libraries.

JavaScript (Node.js): Good for web applications.


Sample Python Code Outline:

import tweepy
import requests

# Twitter API credentials
api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
access_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_SECRET'

# Authenticate with Twitter
auth = tweepy.OAuth1UserHandler(api_key, api_secret, access_token, access_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth)

def get_twitter_following():
    following = []
    for page in tweepy.Cursor(api.get_friends, count=200).pages():
        following.extend(page)
    return [user.screen_name for user in following]

def check_bluesky_user(username):
    # Placeholder for checking Bluesky
    # Implement API call or other method
    return False

def main():
    twitter_following = get_twitter_following()
    for username in twitter_following:
        if check_bluesky_user(username):
            send_notification(username)

def send_notification(username):
    print(f'{username} has joined Bluesky!')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

Notes:

Bluesky Check Placeholder: You'll need to fill in the logic for checking if a user exists on Bluesky.

Error Handling: Add try-except blocks to handle exceptions.

Logging: Implement logging to monitor the script's activity.


7. Handle Data Responsibly

Privacy Considerations:

Data Storage: Securely store any data you collect.

Compliance: Ensure adherence to data protection laws like GDPR.


8. Testing

Unit Tests: Write tests to verify each part of your code works as expected.

Dry Runs: Perform tests with a small number of users.


9. Deployment

Environment Setup: Use virtual environments to manage dependencies.

Version Control: Utilize Git for version control.

Hosting: Consider cloud services if you need the tool to be always online.


10. Alternatives and Enhancements

Third-Party Tools: Research if existing tools meet your needs.

Community Collaboration: Engage with developer communities for supporrt.",0,2024-11-16 02:52:35,0.0751232,t3_1gs5z97,0,588

""Despite their return, the financial commitment from these brands has drastically reduced.

So they're spending 2% of what they used to. That's not exactly a big comeback. *Hopefully* BlueSky's user base will continue to grow, and Twitter's will continue to drop - if it does, we'll see what happens after that.

Social media will always suck. I just want it to be a little better about not misinforming massive amounts of people, and an exodus from Twitter to BlueSky would help.

Honestly I hate it but I kind of agree with him.

Why exactly are you getting a bill to protect politicians and nobody else? From my understanding of the US's 1st amendment it's pretty much exactly what it's talking about, and I'm guessing they added the parody exception to try and make it better.

But really the law itself is kind of amusing. So it applies to deep fakes right? It's defined in there as something that would deceive the average person, so tell me if it only applies to what would fool people and they also are requiring a system where people can report violations, so would anything reported be a deep fake or a false positive since generally that would be done by an average person?

An while I get that they have to make some of it more general, but they say they have to use ""state-of-the-art"" techniques to find them themselves. No real guidance on what that means, just state of the art. With technology that changes all the time so people would be in violation no matter what they did. Well that, and how do you only scan political pictures? Are there any privacy concerns on a social media platform and scanning media? Does it apply only to public facing media or does it apply to any(I'm pretty sure it doesn't say, so I guess they have to be able to look at any of it).

So ya. I think the guy's a shmuck, his motivation is so crooked I'm surprised he can walk but also think the law is stupid.

What's weird is that the off time parts of it seem to have the makings of something a bit better. The labeling of misinformation isn't so bad(still has the whole bits with scanning and the bar for notices I suppose).

Impersonation only applies when you are attempting to fool people into believing you are the person you claim to be, hence why I believe if it’s obviously a fake or a disclaimer is given, deep fakes are covered by the first amendment.

Common expected response where intention is to dismiss deflect detract display no ability to articulate on the topic at handonly narrative talking points in buzzwords have they had ability to display critical thinking or independent thought they would have done so instead as soon as they're required to articulate on the topic at hand suddenly they can't read too good

Typically these interactions are all the same  history and their interactions are all the same, they use the same tactics.


Their intention is to dismiss what was said. Typically they display no ability to articulate on the topic at hand they point fingers blame other's for their problems, while providing nothing of value.



>They're seen in society complaining while providing nothing of value to their employer or their community.

They can be seen after college posting on social media how they're not being paid what they're perceived worth is. Reality their employer would move on perfectly fine without them.  They are likely employed as part of an agreement between a mega corporation and the university to keep the individual employed for a duration of 4 years after that they are off the books for the university student loan delinquency rate.


They'll proceed to claim on social media how they're only working 20% of the week to which their network applauds and cheers.  The reality of the situation the people they surround themselves with leave them at the drop of a hat, as soon as they were of no use or a burden.


They'll continue to display no ability to articulate on the topic at hand, if they had it, they would have said something.  they're intention is to dismiss deflect detract




Typically these trolls can read perfectly fine if they can provide an argument. Usually means they omit 90% of the comment.  Focus on 1 or 2 words  Spell chucks and grammar.  maybe something as big as a full sentence then omit or dismiss the rest.

>Typically if these trolls had an argument they would address it.  With memo talking points narratives and buzzwords no critical thinking no independent thought.

When responded to and required to articulate on the topic at hand.  in their response would  see something along the lines of they can no longer understand what was being said, while they could read reperfectly fine earlier. When they could use narrative memo driven talking points and buzzwords they saw someone else say.


> Suddenly when there is a requirement to articulate on the topic at hand they, can't read too good

I don't use Twitter, but that's only because Musk tends to write checks he can't cash.  He promised that whole ""general amnesty"" thing, but then caved when read the riot act by the EU nanny state.

You know what my account got locked for?  Telling a troll praising the addition of 40,000 new IRS agents to ""Go choke on a boot"".

But no, they want you to submit, pass under the yoke, to which I refused.

Musk promised to undo that, but couldn't manage to do anything other than pardon a bunch of his celebrity friends, like Kanye, who promptly embarrassed him.

Unfortunately it's very easy to get into a bubble and when you fear the other outcome a lot to start bargaining with yourself about how the outcomes you want are truly the most expected ones instead of taking a broader, unbiased look.

Honestly, it's pretty much the same thing as in the David Lynch interview this week. When speaking of his smoking:

Lynch says, “I don’t regret it. It was important to me. I wish what every addict wishes for: that what we love is good for us.”

If it's what you want then it's real easy to convince yourself you're right and harder to take into account the other possibilities.

It's something he built and exists because of the legacy of his work, much of which is racist. 


I can also tell you first hand that the Walt Disney company is more conservative than other Hollywood studios because I was working there pretty recently. It's diverse bit it's also very conservative. Thtas the company culture. 


Disney talk all the time about what a great man Walt was but he wasnt. He was an antisemite, he was anti union, and his movies were disproportionately about women's lives revolving around a man. Yes, they have changed, because a lot of the content they made would literally be illegal to make today, but the legacy of Walt is the reason the company exists. They still have a deeply conservative office culture, they still exploit their employees more than their conpetitors and are anti union, they lobby to make copyright law more restrictive all the time and succeed and they constantly talk about how great Walt was, a man with a deeply racist past.",1,2024-11-16 06:18:05,0.1875,t1_lxcta6i,0,216
